They cannot come any lower than my $350 per month which is really only an interest payment or at least most of it is only an interest payment. My principle comes down only slightly. I am a single mom and pay exhorbatant amts in child care as well as own a small condo and have a reliable car. My life is not extravagent and I can barely afford these things. I need the interest rate or the monthly payment to come down so that I am at least making an impact. It's ridicuous and makes me want to quit paying them altogether never minding the ramifications.

CFPB-2013-0004-4000,Kelly,M,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. Speaking from the point of my husband since my student loans will be in repayment after May 2013, even government Direct Loans are impossible to work with. The interest compounds exponentially. We are paying off our house faster than his loans which NEVER go down. We have actually paid 75% of them back in total, but only $8000 has come off of $60K borrowed. This is ridiculous. They will NEVER be paid off in our lifetime. And with mine fast approaching which include private loans ($60,000 private, $30,000 govt), we are terrified. With the economy, my lay off, I had to return to school for a secure job. And community colleges are NOT going to do it. In nursing, BSNs are starting to be required for most jobs. Private lenders NEED to be regulated and debt needs to have a goal of getting paid off or forgiven. We've hit 1 trillion dollars, now! When is Washington going to wake up to this bubble? Or did we learn nothing from the last decade? How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I think private loan providers are loan sharks and want nothing but their money and they have the means to garnish to get it. Why should they care about us? They compound debt and tell you to figure it out or give you impossible ""options"". On top of this, my husband has student loan debt he had to defer while I was laid off and applying to schools to re-educate myself to join the workforce again with a more solid career: nursing. So we have his debt as well... I'm not just talking about my debt alone. These are FAMILIES they are hurting here.

I have been told a different story every time I call. Each time I contact REDACTED, I amnot eligible for reduced rates as I never seem to fit the undisclosed criteria (ratereduction program, income based repayment plans, etc...). I am currently unwilling to setup a payment plan as I can not afford the terms REDACTED is offering. I have asked for 1%interest so I can afford to make my payment, but REDACTED representatives tell me that Iam only eligible for 3%, of which I cannot afford to do. My other federal loans (notprivate) are currently finishing up their last forebearance period, and I have no idea asto how I will pay these back at an affordable rate! I owe almost $500k total, and havebeen unable to find ample employment to meet the needs of my family and pay REDACTED underthe terms they are offering. I have lost my home, filed for bankruptcy, and continue toseek employment without much success. I still am unable to afford my board exams to evenobtain my medical license to practice medicine! I feel completely devastated and broken. Iworked so hard to get my doctorate in medicine, with hopes of serving others, however,that dream has yet to come to fruition due to lack of financial resources. I desperatelyneed agreeable terms from REDACTED, with clearly defined parameters as to how I mightbecome eligible for a payment plan that works for my current financial situation. I cannotfind this as of now. I am scared of what will happen once my forebearance period expires,and I am required to make monthly payments on 39 seperate loans, all charged a variableinterest rate of between 3-9% compounded daily, and no option provided by REDACTED toconsolidate or come up with an affordable payment plan.

After attending two years at a private university, I returned home due to family crisis. Because I took a semester off before beginning classes at the University of Akron, my loan provider notified me my 30,000$ loan was in re-payment status. At this point, I was enrolled full-time at a four-year university, and thus re-applied for academic deferment. Beginning in February of 2009, I attempted to submit all the requisite paperwork to my loan company, after being told something different by every person I spoke with at the company. Every time I called, they said they had not received the documents. This went on for several months, all the while I was still accruing interest and late payments for my loans. This persisted even after I sent the documents CERTIFIED MAIL! At which point I threatened to call the Attorney General's Office, and my paperwork was magically found. However, the company maintained that because I took a semester off school, my loans were not eligible for academic deferment, nor was I eligible to renegotiate from a 10 year repayment plan to a 30 year one. My only option was to pay $250 a month, even though I was only making 11,000$/year. I was also told I could not apply for a financial need lowered repayment.

The biggest problem with the loan is the compounded interest that has accrued on it. I actually only borrowed 36 K and used it to get two degrees. But over ten years of never having an adequate income to repay the loan, the compound interest has raised the loan to about 70 K. My income, over ten years, however, has only risen to about 30 K per year. My lender (SALLIE MAE) originally offered lower payments: 100 per mounth, rather than 250 per month. I made those payments for one year but my principle continued to rise. So, I realized I was wasting money, and at the time was only earning about 20 K per year.

Almost impossible to reach anyone, when calling I am put on hold for 15-20 min then transferred to a voicemail, messages are returned outside of business hours and those returning the message cannot answer simple questions and recommend calling back during business hours. The questions asked in this survey are too pointed, especially ""*16. How would you consider your ability to pay your monthly private loan payment?"" Just because I have the ability to pay my monthly payment does not necessarily mean that I think the monthly payments are reasonable. I'm currently in a fixed rate private loan at 6.6% interest. This interest rate is unreasonable. I've always paid on time and never missed a payment in the 5 years since I entered repayment. My solution to the debt issue is to allow borrowers to refinance at lower fixed rates and repay student debt pre-tax. You can contribute to health care and retirement pre-tax so why not student debt? This would be a relatively easy fix, with mechanisms already in place (similar to a 401K or HSA account).

I was unemployed for 6 months after completing grad school, so when I got my first job my ""grace period"" was already over. All of my student loan payments were due within my first month of working, private and federal loans. If I would have paid what they said I owed each month, the cost would have exceeded 80% of my take home pay. I tried to consolidate as many loans as possible during this time and start paying back what I could afford, but a lack of cooperation from the private lenders just made me frustrated. I ended up having severe anxiety at this time and had to start going to a therapist because of the stress caused by my student loan debt. My credit is completely shot now and I am not up-to-date on any of my loan payments. The entire process is too confusing because I have multiple lenders. None of them take into consideration the other loans when assessing how much I can afford to pay each month. I would gladly pay a reasonable amount of money each month to all of the lenders, but I have yet to figure out how to do it.

This is my problem, the school kicked me out, because I couldn't afford the books for class. The next thing I know, I am getting calls from the school saying I owed them 500, for the class, they kicked me out for. Then, I start getting calls from the loan company, telling me I owed them 6000 for my school loans. I took only three classes, one self evalution course, and two english classes. The school, said I owed them 500, for the computer class, that I never took. Three courses at 500 a piece runs 1500. And the finance company, wants 6000 thousand.

My recent experience has been good. I've heard about the income-based payback plan and am going to go that route. My worst experience that continues to haunt my family with financial burden was being tricked into doing a spousal consolidation loan. Over the phone the direct loans agent pitched the whole thing to me just as an easy way to pay for all of my wife's and my loans with one payment. I didn't know that I was locking in $90k in loans at 7.5% forever. This situation is at the core of our financial problems. We needed to file bankruptcy this year, but of course, there is no bankruptcy route for student loans. I'm currently not making my student loan payments just to get our heads above water. Once my 2012 taxes are done, I will apply for the income-based payment plan, which will erase my loans after 120 payments, if I understand that program correctly.

Originally, my private loans were around $150. However, I was short on money at one point, and I could not make the full payment. I called them and they reduced my monthly payment to interest only at around $100 per month. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I am a mixed bag on this. The payments they lowered mine to were manageable only because I paid interest only and had to defer my Federal loans continuously to afford paying them. Originally I took out a total of around $9000 for my student loans. I paid around $8000 on this loan, and I now owe $12,000. I find this criminal. In addition, I was forced back into school to find a decent paying job because of this lousy economy, and I have taken out an additional $6000 in private loans since going back to school for another degree. I worry sometimes about how much money I will have to pay when I graduate, but I feel like there is no other way to obtain job stability but to become an RN. I am passionate about healthcare, but I don't think private banks should be allowed to make profits off students.

This loan was obtained by me to help my daughter, a 19-year-old single mother at the time.I was financially comfortable at the time, and had no problems making payments--in fact,had paid the over 9k loan down to just over 4k when my husband's business, which had allour assets tied up as collateral, failed. I was bankrupt. My attorney, who was eitheruneducated on student loan debt or unaware I had it, told me to stop paying all unsecureddebt immediately. Unfortunately, I did, and the loan went into default. I filed forbankruptcy, my home was foreclosed and sold at auction--I lost everything--at over 50,this is a hard blow to overcome financially. I contacted the collection agency that myloan had been assigned to and inquired about the possibility of forgiveness of the loanfor hardship reasons ( I was now penniless, homeless, and a single wage earner who hadbeen winding down my career toward retirement) , and was told that I am ""lucky"" --thatthey see parents all the time with over 100k in student loans who have been struck downwith terminal cancer, and even *they* don't qualify for hardship status.Once I waseducated on student loan debt, I immediately set up to repay the loan, now back up toalmost 8k, and get it out of default, fully disclosing to the servicer that I was planningto file for bankruptcy, but wanted to get started and get back on track. I was assured Icould continue paying the loan, although I would have to ""call in"" the payments, since theservicer would not be able to bill me while I was in bankruptcy. After I filed and triedto call in my monthly payment, I was told I no longer had an account there, that it wouldbe placed in a pool and assigned to another company when my bankruptcy was discharged. Itwas. Now I am back where I started, with [Redacted], who originally gave me the loan, andI they have told me that there is absolutely no program in place to help me. I just haveto pay it, which I'll do, but this isn't right. Not morally, ethically, and it *shouldn't* be right legally, either. What protection or relief does bankruptcy really offer thosein trouble if they can't get out from under the crushing debt of student loans (in manycases, not in mine, thankfully--with me,it is just an ongoing frustration and reminder ofwhat is not right about the system as it is)? The upside is that my daughter did finishcollege , although she transferred out of the private college she was attending within thefirst year (because of the high tuition, mostly) and received her BS at the University ofTennessee entirely on grants and financial aid, and is gainfully employed. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? The first collection company assigned to the debt were always helpful and were actuallywho explained to me how the system works, Since the debt has gone back to [Redacted], itseems they do everything they can to make sure I feel a black cloud hanging over me.

CFPB-2013-0004-4286,Jonathan,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. The problem is not with affording loan payments, the problem is with the cost of for-profit schools. They pressure you into attending the school and handle all the loan information through their financial aid office, keeping you mostly in the dark, and assuring you that once you graduate it will be easy to repay. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? My private loan provider also holds my federal loans. Again, the issue is with the cost of school and the deals the for-profit schools make with loan providers without fully acquiring informed consent from the student, not with the students ability to pay back loans. Having a student sign a statement allowing the school to obtain loans on their behalf is not proper consent. They need to be informed of the consequences. In my situation, I was under the impression I would accrue 25k in debt, but at the end of my program at AIU, it was double that amount, and I feel the education I received was inferior at AIU compared to where I am now. While I know their education program has improved, no one has questioned the ethics of for-profit schools and the outrageous cost burdens they impose on their mostly lower income student population. That is what needs to be uncovered.                                                            ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-4286

In the past, they lost checks and then blamed us for their incompetence, and as soon as they started calling asking about a payment, they'd call multiple times a day every day, beginning between 7 - 9 AM during the week and on the weekends. Finally, when I've spoken to them, their employees don't understand what I am saying, because they are uneducated (they are fluent English speakers), which is extremely frustrating. Frankly, I am very glad the law changed, because my younger sister will never have to deal with them. I have found their methods to be tantamount to harassment on numerous occasions, and I am someone whose parents can afford (and are willing) to pay my loans.

After two (of three) years of law school, REDACTEDtold me I had too much outstanding debt to get another loan. All that debt was throughthem! How could I possibly pay it back if I couldn't even finish school? How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? Private student loans are the devil's plaything. Everyone employed by, or invested in, aprivate student lender should be sent to Guantanamo Bay. I've been paying loans since2006, and never missed a payment. Ever. In that time I've paid back well over $60,000.I still owe well over $100K, and have to pay a minimum of $1,200 per month. Of course,none of this is dischargeable via bankruptcy. What a scam.

Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I have split loans between 2 private vendors now. All of my loans have been sold off multiple times. Right now i am in a good place. I have always put my loans first. I have incredible credit and i do not plan on hurting that. My biggest problem is my graduate school was ""Unsubsidized"" so the interest is crazy, around 6.5-7%. My Subsidized loan is around 3.5% which is manageable, but still school loans should be much lower interest. I have been making at least double payments on my 7% loan since i started it and i have knocked off 1/3rd of it in about 3 years. I plan on finishing it off this year or early next year and then i will get rid of my bigger lower interest loan. I truly believe that every penny i put towards my loans should be tax deductible, not just the stupid interest. If people are paying off their education, they should get a reward for being sort of screwed over. I believe you would see much less loan defaulting if they could put all of their payments on their taxes, also people would probably also pay off their loans much faster. I know i would if I was getting money off my taxes for paying off my debt faster. These are my 2 cents. I hope some politician gets behind this idea. Lets get our future out of debt!                                                                ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-4356
CFPB-2013-0004-4357,Josh,R,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. No bank has been willing to discuss consolidation or better terms. The best I have been offered is a non-binding verbal assurance that if I didn't pay for a while under a deferment plan it ""wouldn't be that bad"" etc. But these deferment options are only available for a total of one year over the lifetime of the loan. How am I to know that I won't need that more in 15-20 years? It's simply not safe to participate in the deferment, as it only leads to more debt later on. As far as rate negotiations, I've never been offered any actual help or refinancing, even as these banks are making record profits. Part of my problem is that for every year in school, I have a separate lender, due to the string of bankruptcies, and now each bank treats my loan separately. This leads to 5 separate billings a month, all at or above $100. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

I have private student loans with REDACTED. I have tried contacting them SEVERAL timessince graduating college in 2010. I always let them know that I am not trying to get outof paying my student loans, but would like to negotiate a reasonable monthly payment. Upongraduating I was inly able to obtain part time employment in the psychology field. I madeless than 1200 per month, and REDACTED wanted nearly 1000, which would leave me withnothing to live on. I tried to negotiate a payment of about 400 per month, until I found asustainable job, and I was told that my loan would still go into default because they wantthe full $1000 payment each month. Through my experiences with them I have been hung up ontwice, and lied to about a low income repayment program (not federal) that did not exist.I have also been ""advised"" by several REDACTED representatives that I should just go backto school if I cannot afford my loans. I have been paying 150 every 3 months since May of2010, to keep my loans in forbearance to avoid default. I am currently in graduate school,utilizing federal loans only, so that I am able to progress in my career. I have paid allof my federal loans on time each month since May 2010, because they offered more repaymentoptions. Private student loans have ruined my life. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? My private loan provider REDACTED have been professional, but difficult to work withbecause they read from a script and have no real knowledge on how to help the consumers.Many of the personnel are foreign and have accents that are difficult to understand. Myoverall impression of REDACTED, is that they dont truely care about the students that theylend money to. The entire process seems like a scam, and I am scared to go into defaultbecause then my wages will be garnished and I'll end up homeless and unemployed. Thesepeople seem heartless and cruel.

I don't think either of my student loans are private loans. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? Why all the focus on 'private' loans? I am not even certain what private means in this context. I'm pretty sure both my loans were government loans. I went to a private technical school in 1985, and was not able to get a job afterwards that was even enough to pay for my basic needs as an American citizen. I began making payments, yet over the course of a couple of years found myself falling behind as interest began to increase the balance owed. It has now been 20 years since I have made a payment, and have spent about 1/3 of this time homeless and poverty-stricken. (The other 2/3 of the time I was barely able to keep myself solvent!)It's been a real struggle to live in this country. The Treasury Department and the IRS have siezed every income tax refund I have earned since 1987, and I would suspect they have collected in this time substantially more than I originally owed.

I am a co-signer on a private student loan with my son. Supposedly after two years of on-time payments there was to be co-signer release. However, even with 100% on-time payments, we have been denied the release.

CFPB-2013-0004-4447,Mary,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. When I first encountered a period of unemployment following college graduation and the end of my grace period, my private lender was able to give me a 6 month forbearance until I was employed once again. This helped a lot at the time. However, my monthly payment eats up a significant amount of my income. Because of this I cannot afford to live on my own and I am still living with my parents. I would like more than anything to have some level of independence and be able to rent an apartment by myself but I cannot do this with my current monthly payment. I tried contacting the lender and they had no solutions for me - basically they said this is your monthly payment and I will be paying that until the loan is paid off. There is no more flexibility. I want to be able to pay something towards my loan each month but I would also like to live independently and not struggle each month to make ends meet.

When I first graduated with my doctorate I was doing an internship and post doc fellowship for little money and they continued to defer my loans. When I began paying it was 6-8% and my payment was $600 per month. Several years ago I was approached for a lower interest rate, 4% and lower monthly payments, $250 per month.

I was unable to make payments because of lack of money. When I got a job I made payments and when I lost my job I continued to make payments because I was told after so long they would lower my interest rate. I was giving money that I needed for food and rent to pay of my loans, thinking I'd get a reduced rate. In the end they told me they had said ""they might reduce it"" and did not. I stopped making payments and have not since then. They lied to me and took the little amount of money I had to live on.

CFPB-2013-0004-4493,Mary Jo,V,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I am not unique. There are many people I know that want to pay back there student loans. What has happened over the years is this: If you are going to school for any type of Social Work position, you find work, but also find that the pay is extremely low. When you get your first bill for your student loan your bill is more than one weeks pay. In my case I was raising three children as a single mother, and could not afford the monthly payment. As far back as the year 2000 I suggested that federal and private student loans should be paid back on a sliding scale, according to a persons income. I could have paid 99 dollars a month for all of these years. Instead, I was forced into hardship differments year after year. So, an original debt of 30 thousand dollars is now coming close to 90 thousand dollars. Now, I am 58 years old, a displaced worker because of the recession, lack of work, and the cutbacks in Social work both in the State and not for profit agencies. If the federal goverment would create a forgiveness of interest, and have students pay on the original debt on a sliding scale, according to individual income then people could afford to pay back their student debt. I believe the loan departments purposely put people into differments because they believe they will be paid all of the interest. However, in most cases, people die before they can pay they amount of money and the loans never get paid back. Why not take the original amount and take smaller payments from millions of people and get your millions that way? Greed in corporate America is costing everyone more than just money. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I would not consider that loan provider a problem. The loan provider is following the rules, and making sure you keep owing the federal goverment more and more money.

Affordable payment options do nothing more than extend the length of the loan, requiring you to pay back even more over the life of the loan. Considering I am already going to be paying back over $450,000 for $210,000 in loans, why would I want to try and make it $500,000 or even $600,000? Really, I just wish I could claim the $10,000+ dollars in interest on my taxes. I make ""too much"" but I need that to be able to pay my loans. I make just over $100,000 and I still live pay check to pay check because I owe my 1st, 2nd, and even 3rd born child cause I didn't have other alternatives to pay for school.

In early 2011, I was unable to make my monthly payments because I was not making enough money at work. I called my private student loan company to try and get lower payments until I could afford more, but they told me they could not do anything for me. I explained to them that I could pay part of the amount, but they told me if I couldn't send the whole payment, I might as well not bother sending it at all, because my account would still be considered delinquent. At no time did they try to work with me, they basically shrugged me off. I missed 2 monthly payments and because I have 12 loans with them, I now have 24 delinquencies on my credit report. My credit score is ruined for the foreseeable future because they were unable to work with me. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

Unprofessional and difficult to work with doesn't even begin to describe it. Their mentality is give me your money and shut up. You want help?

I have found that Sallie Mae is worse than an uncaring lender. They obfuscate communications to the extent that they reneg on promises by confusing issues with false paper work. I applied for the APLE loan forgiveness program as a qualified teacher in a school under program improvement with a student body that is over 60% qualifiers for free lunch. I was promised a $17,000 reduction in my loan amount for staying at my school for 5 years. I am finishing my 7th year and they (APLE) has disputed the fact of my teaching there!

CFPB-2013-0004-4598,Krista,C,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I applied for the IBR program and have been on it for a couple of years as it is the only way to make my payments manageable. It has been like pulling teeth to actually get up front information and any documentation about this program. Getting on the program itself wasn't hard - they sent me the forms, etc. But they will never send me any hard copy documentation (or digital) that state by name that I am on the IBR program nor tell me what the terms of the arrangement are. (the specifics of how payment is determined - I always have fees called 'late fees' of 100 dollars attached to my monthly invoice even though I pay them every month in full - including the fees. And when I call to talk about this I get through to about 5 different people each telling me something different about how they are applied. I cannot get documentation stating that I am on the program nor when I started or anything else. They just say they don't send that information. This transparency of important to me because without it it feels like they can do whatever they want. For instance, when I was rehabilitating my loans after default -- I was 3 months into the program when they told me that interest rates had changed and so they were going to restart my clock of rehabilitation - making the terms 3 months longer than originally agreed. Also, when I first went into default - I was told that my balance went up so high because I was fined 15,000 for each loan (there were two). How can you give someone a 15,000 fine who is struggling to make payments? It's completely exploitative. Yet - these fines were never documented anywhere as fines - just added to my balance. I would really love transparent information because so much of what they are doing feels at the very least unethical, if not illegal. And the emotional distress of trying to deal with the unmanageable payments and the shifting terms and explanations often has me in tears. If I weren't on the IBR program there would be no way I could afford my payments of over 1000 per month. And my decision to make a career change and leave teaching and non-profits for design work was largely influenced by my loans. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? They are not professional. No one seems to know what they are talking about. Often I'm more familiar with the program I'm on then they are. Sometimes I have to explain it to them. There is no transparency of information. Often they are belittling over the phone. It's been a nightmare. Terms shift and it all feels very unfair and deliberately confusing.                                                            ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-4598

I can not pay at this time because I am home with a child with multiple disabilities. We are trying to live on one income and my husband also has student loans.

CFPB-2013-0004-4706,Kyle,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I carry three private loans, each about $20,000 before interest. Two are from Sallie Mae and one from another bank. While some options to defer for a short period of time (three months) were available, I have never been able to lower payments. Last year, I was working a minimum-wage service job (it was all that I could find) and both the bank and Sallie Mae refused to negotiate rates. I was able to pay $50 to Sallie Mae to postpone payments for three months on one loan, during which time they expected me to find a better job. Where that job was supposed to come from, I do not know. My other Sallie Mae loan, the ""Smart Option"" loan, does not offer any other payment options at all: I either pay $188/month or deal with the consequences. (If you don't pay, they will call and harass you all day and night: they do this to many of my friends now). When making minimum wage, $200/month is an incredible amount of extra money to come up with on top of rent, bills, food, other loans, etc. During this time, my Federal loans were much easier to deal with: I was able to cap payments at 10% of my income. Altogether, more than 80% of my income was going to loan payments, leaving little for anything else, so I began to dip into credit cards again. I eventually enrolled in graduate school, where I am now living on a stipend (I make $13,000/year now), but I still have to pay $200 a month to the Sallie Mae Smart Option loan, which does not let me defer even while in school. $200 a month is a lot of money to me right now, but there's nothing I can do. In my experience, Sallie Mae is a terrible institution that has ruined my life. I will be a slave to the banks for as long as I live now. Why? Because I wanted to go to college. Who knew that going to college would turn out to be the worst decision in my life? I did not know what I was getting into when I was 17 and took out my first loan.

Since graduating I have gotten married and received my green card. My wife and I own a house and I am no longer a flight risk, but the high interest rates on my student loans make my payments more than our mortgage and cause us considerable financial strain. I've requested multiple times to have my interest rate lowered. No term extensions or principal reduction, but because I have a cosigner all of my requests have been denied. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? The people I speak with are always professional and I recognize that they are not the decision makers, but I think overall the banks have done to students what they did to homeowners. These private loans are predatory and there needs to be some kind of relief for students like me who are working hard and trying to make ends meet.

CFPB-2013-0004-4730,Lara,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I received a deferment for a period of 6 months, during which time the loan was still accruing interest (for each month, during which I would normally have been paying $170, the loan accrues $90 of interest). At the end of this period, the interest was rolled back into the loan and payments continued as before. There is no option to lower my payments and while I had a reprieve it cost me almost $600. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I think they are unprofessional. I have paid on time every single month since graduating save for once. That time I was one week late and they had collections calling the house which I think was completely inappropriate for a payment a week late. It seems like it would be in their best interests to lower my payments, allow me to continue growing my business and be a viable member of society, able to pay the loan back. The lowered payments wouldn't harm them at all, they would still be accruing the staggering amount of interest (50% of each payment I make pays of that month's interest).

Both my husband and I have an overwhelming amount of student debt. We have additional debt to that and we were also victims of the Countrywide fraud. We have a 2 yr old and between student debt, high interest rate, hospital bill and paying for childcare we cannot pay for our student loans. However when I try calling to defer our loans or workout a deal most of the associates are very rude and say we make too much money. One even told me to get a 2nd job. This is not an option because it would increase our childcare costs and I need to spend time with my daughter. She is my priority.

I finally became so discouraged that I began ignoring correspondence altogether, as there was no way I could pay the $700+ monthly private loan payments for the 3 lenders when I only make $11/hr. I was informed I am now in the early stages of default with AES, and I'm hanging by a thread paying $177/month to Salle Mae to keep from defaulting with them. I also owe my school about $1,500, but I'm not worred about that compared to how much I owe everyone else. My Federal loans are the only ones for which I've been able to obtain helpful deferments, forbearances, and payment options. I would like to state here for the record that the ONLY way I was EVER able to make all of my loan payments was during a time I worked two part-time jobs (totaling full-time hours) AND was a live-in companion for an elderly woman, who provided me room and board with a monthly stipend. This essentially put me in a position where my life was not my own, and my sole purpose in existing was to pay down student loans. I had no opportunity to spend time with existing friends, much less pursue establishing new relationships, furthering my education, or planning for a comfortable future. I see now way out other than default. A person can only work so many hours and devote so much of their life to debt repayment. I'm not looking for a free pass, just a feasible plan for repaying my debt. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? Sallie Mae is absolutely the worst lender. At one time I was receiving 3-4 collection calls per day. Recently they scaled back to one or two, but it is still disturbing when you want to pay and the only option they give you prevents you from making payments on any of your other loans. The customer service people are generally kind and try to be helpful--it's the lack of options they are allowed to present that is the problem.

CFPB-2013-0004-4835,Leah,C,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I have enormous student loan debt, but I haven't yet had any issues with paying it off (knock on wood). If I would run into any bad luck healthwise or other, I know I would be in a very bad situation financially because of my debt. During my time in grad school I was able to defer repayment for several years. This was key to me being to afford repayments because I made very little during grad school. Knowing that my debt was so large, I was very conscientious of my spending from the time I graduated with my BA. I continue to do what I can to save money and spend less, but it is a difficult balancing act. My husband and I feel like we have very little choice with what to do with our money - as much as possible has to go towards student loan payments! We could really use a better car and we are living in the cheapest (livable) apartment that we can find. We also cut corners by taking public transport instead of driving to work, although our lives would be much more convenient if we drove and paid for parking. Finally, we really have no idea how we would be able to support a family if/when we decide to have children. We say this is all for pursuing our careers, and we are happy. However, the price of pursuing our careers is extremely high. On top of that, my alma mater sends requests for donations! I feel very guilty for not supporting Luther College, but there is no way I can be expected to pay off my loans AND donate. This makes me particularly angry. I know that tuition has continued to increase at Luther College and then they send requests and call me for donations, but the amount of their tuition/room & board is the reason why I am in so much debt. I consider my decision to attend that school a huge financial mistake. I could have gotten an equally good (if not better?) education at U of Iowa without as much debt, but the 18 year old me thought that a private liberal arts education was superior. Unfortunately, I am unable to recommend Luther College to any high school student for this single reason (financial). It is a nice place and all, but spending that much money on an education is foolish when there are cheaper, yet equally good options. I wish that I would have had more understanding of this when I was 18. It is a very important factor, yet I feel I was swayed more by superficial factors about Luther compared to public universities. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? My impression is favorable. I haven't had any problems paying my debt, but I have the feeling that if I did I would be able to talk to them and receive assistance with lowering monthly payments. Every bill I receive advertises that they are willing to help out if the burden of paying the loans is too much.

So far I have been able to postpone my payments due to my financial situation. I was able to defer my loans while I was enrolled in school. I graduated in May 2011 and was unemployed until August 2012. During that time my interest was still adding up because I did not qualify for an ""unemployment"" forbearance since they don't consider being unable to find work after graduation to be ""unemployment.""

Essentially, anytime dealing with [Redacted] is a joke. A good majority of the time the""professional"" service representatives have no clue what they are doing and offer littlehelp or options in making monthly payments affordable. I actually was able to speak onetime with someone at [Redacted] who was higher up the line - his advice for paying for theenormous monthly payment was to ""get a second job"" and had suggested anything - even adishwasher at a bar/restaurant. I'm not belittling those types of lower-end service jobs,however, I did not go to college with the intention of having to work TWO jobs and besaddled with student loan debt for the rest of my life. Before I went back to school(mostly in part to take advantage of deferment), my monthly payments were approximately$800. I still pay approximately $300/month to my private loans, but that doesn't even makea dent with a majority of that payment being gobbled up by high interest rates.

They simply wouldn't allow me to pay anything less than what they wanted me to pay. It finally was transferred to a collection agency at which point I was able to get them down to $250 monthly payment. This was for my private loans.

The ""customer service"" rep I spoke with was condescending, judgmental, and chastising. When I explained my position to him, he literally told me I should not have taken loans I couldn't afford to pay back (as if that was my plan all along). I already had/have a tremendous amount of fear and shame surrounding this debt and I went into the call with that shame, but willing and hoping to work out a solution suitable for both of us. But, after he told me that I hung up on him. He must've known he was out of line because he called me back and said that after looking at my loans he could put me on an interest only payment plan for 2 years that would substantially lower my monthly payments. When I graduated from NU in May 2006 I had about $77k in federal and private loans. I had been advised to defer them as my monthly payment was about $1,000/mon and I was at the time making 35k/yr. That was nearly twice my rent. I was completely and utterly overwhelmed. By summer 2009 when I made that call the interest had ballooned my balance to 100k dollars. The rep chastised me for that as well. I am still only paying the interest on the 2 largest private loans and my total balance after four years of $600 monthly payments is still over $91,000. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? Without a doubt unprofessional and difficult to deal with. I would use the word predatory. But, that is by design so you can't really blame the personnel. It is with their employers where the problem lies. These lenders have a tremendous amount of power (money) and sway in Washington. The laws in place make it easy for them and difficult for us. The whole system needs to be dismantled and reworked from the ground up. But as student loan debt has now surpassed credit card debt in this country, and reached 1 Trillion dollars, I won't hold my breath. Thank you for all you're trying to do though. It's a good fight.                                                            ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-4932

But i usually tell them, this is absurd: in the ""Best Country of the World"" people cannot afford going to College because they will graduate and not have a suficient income to pay for their studant loans?

I was not able to work with my private lender REDACTED to change my monthly paymentoptions. I was basically told ""too bad"" and ""we don't care what you can afford, this iswhat you owe"". The only solutions I was able to use were deferment and forebearance, whichonly helped for short periods of time. They refused to even discuss extending the loanterm so I could lower the monthly payment. And then they went and sold the loan toREDACTED without notifying me prior.

I suppose the peopleI spoke to were professional, but I wouldn't consider them fair. Although, to be fair onmy part, I fully understand that the rules are what they are and can't be changed by everyperson I talked to on the phone, however the management/ supervisors did nothing to helpme out either. I strongly feel that there can, and should, be exceptions made on a case bycase basis to those people who need it. REDACTED was also what I consider to be harassing,calling several times a day, even on Sundays and holidays, when I was past due on mypayments. REDACTED has been much easier to deal with, but I have been past due on theloans since they bought them so my experience with them has been limited.

It is clear they outsource calls to countries outside of the US which leaves more room for miscommunication or difficulty understanding what is already a complicated and overwhelming subject. I have had long wait times, then have had difficulty on multiple occasions hearing or understanding the representative for my loan. I don't feel they take much time or care into working with their student loan clients directly to find them the best plan.

They were very hard to even get a hold of. I spent at least 2 hours just trying to get someone on the phone.

They told me that I didn't have any options - that my loan payment had to be made and if I can't make it, it can go into default and hurt my credit. They reminded me that student loans cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy and I just had to pay them. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? They're basically terrible. I just wish there had been some sort of counseling upfront - a real discussion about the costs of the loan. I was the first person in my family to go to college, raised by a single parent, and I just had to sign a form to get an incredibly high-interest loan. I started the process when I was 17. The only thing I understood was that I had to go to college to be successful in life. Now, I'm an adult who barely has any savings, is afraid to get married because of how my loan will impact my partner's credit rating, and can't move forward with adult milestones. It's really hard. I thought that I did everything ""right,"" but the debt is truly overwhelming.

CFPB-2013-0004-5007,Melissa,B,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender ingaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. The answer to question 14 is most accurately a combination of ""Very unwilling"" and ""Couldnot reach"". My private lender is REDACTED, and I have literally never worked with a morehostile or unhelpful company. Most attempts to communicate go ignored. I've been stuckwith them about 10 years now because when I first graduated the payments were far too highto make on an entry level salary, which was much lower than the school led me to believeit would be. My attempts to work with REDACTED have been mostly related to trying tolower interest rates, get them to consolidate my loans correctly, and get them to applypayments correctly where I want them (legally they are supposed to follow my instructionsfor applying payments, but they often don't and I believe this is intentional on theirpart). Attempting to get them to consolidate my private loans into one was a hellishnightmare spanning weeks of negotiation, and I still didn't get them to do it. I know itis legal and possible, because one of my friends accomplished it, by a marathon six hourphone session with them. No, I am NOT joking about that. My most recent experiencewith them was when I had gotten an unexpected tax credit and decided to use it to pay offmy smallest loan. I sent the payment for the correctly calculated payoff figure andprovided clear instructions to apply the payment to that loan only in order to extinguishits balance. Instead, they applied it across all loans. I sent an e-mail to ask them toapply it the way I had directed, and never received an acknowledgement. It took four moree-mails and finally I was bracing myself to have to have a phone call with them (always ahideous experience lasting usually at least an hour), before weeks later my account waseventually corrected. I have no idea what caused them to finally do as I had been askingall along. I have never worked with a company less ethical or more obviously out toharm its supposed clients for profit. I have never had another company actually make mecry when I have to deal with them. I was essentially misled about the compounding interestwhen I took out these loans, which are now MUCH more than the original balances because itwas not explained to me that interest would accrue while I was in school and unable toafford payments on them. It feels like I will be a prisoner of REDACTED until I retire,unless I can do something dramatic to extinguish this debt. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? I hate them with the fury of a thousand suns. REDACTED impresses me as unethical andunprofessional in the extreme, and I believe that they make things as difficult forborrowers as possible so that we will give up on getting more advantageous rates, loweringpayments, etc. etc. Based on how painful they make every interaction with them, I believethis is deliberate and calculated. I think they only give you what you want if you persistlong enough to make them think you might actually attempt legal action against them. Ithink they also make routine interactions and transactions unpleasant, to discourageanyone from even attempting to do anything more ambitious. They have no incentive todeliver anything remotely resembling service, because they know that we are stuck withthem. Credit unions and banks don't want to buy our loans out. This is our lot and theyexploit that pretty ruthlessly. REDACTED takes the shame of being in so much stupid,youthful debt to a whole new level by treating its borrowers every bit like the chattelthey clearly consider us to be.

I considered the phone calls harassment, because they had all of my current contact information -- I reached out to them because I started a new job and was seeking a temporary hardship deferment or forbearance, something easily extended by my federal lenders.

Phone conversation assisted. Low pay is a State of Texas job and cost of living is the reason why we need lower payments. Otherwise there would be no other option except to default on loan. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? It isn't securing money from a lender. Our society has made affordable tuition out of reach. I was lucky to finish my program. Most students don't complete their programs and are stuck with the bills, too. The education opportunities in this country have become an industry of overpriced text books and outrageous tuition and parking prices. Most students have to take out loans because they only make minimum wages, which just isn't keeping up with the cost of living and paying for education. Also higher pay jobs post graduation are hard to secure.                                                            ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-5018

I was asked to pay $500 a month which would leave me only $500 to live on a month. Impossible. I asked to lower payment to $200. They said they could, however, the lower payment would mean that I would have to pay $700 the next year. Which for me, would be impossible. It was extremely frustrated. Having been sick for 2 years, diagnosed then treated for cancer, it took me a total of 5 years to be able to work again. It's difficult since I am just now getting back on my feet and working. It's also very difficult because the money is so easy to get, and so hard to pay off.

The only options they've given me have been, in this order: deferment, extended repayment, and interest only. Meanwhile the principle continues to snowball. My original loan amount was $72k (at 9.25% interest.) The new principle is $106k, and that's even with me paying $25k towards my debt over the past 5 years. I am not in default and have never missed a payment. Once, I essentially had an agent tell me my only hope of escaping the debt was death. (Calls are recorded, so I'm sure they could pull that exact conversation pretty easily!) How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? Professional, but cold, robotic, systematic, by the book. Professional does not mean accommodating, fair or understanding. Very difficult to talk to someone in the USA. Taking out Sallie Mae Signature Student Loans was the worst mistake I've ever made in my entire life. I've contemplated suicide many times because it seems like I have no hope of ever negotiating the terms, negotiating a lower repayment amount, nor achieving an income level sufficient to repay the ridiculous principle that has snowballed because of capitalizing interest. I feel like I have to live my life on a ball and chain. I can't invest in other areas of my life, nor contribute to the economy the way I would like to be able to. Why? Because I'm a slave to this monster.                                                            ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-5075

CFPB-2013-0004-5088,Meredith,S,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I was simply told that there were no options available to me at this time (I had already exhausted my forbearance/deferment options, and did not qualify for economic hardship forbearance). When I stated that I could not make the monthly payment, the lender told me that they would ""go after"" my co-signer for payment. In fact, when I was behind on payments at one point, the lender customer service reps repeatedly threatened to contact my co-singer, and stated that the co-signer was ""on the hook for my lack of payment."" How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? Unscrupulous, unreasonable, highway robbers. Personnel are (mostly) unprofessional on the phone, rude, and difficult to work with. One of the most frustrating aspects of dealing with them is that I frequently get completely different answers/responses from different personnel from the same lender, when I ask what options are available to me to lower my monthly payment. No one seems to know anything, or to be interested in helping me find an alternative solution. Maybe that's because there are no alternative solutions? In any event, it is shameful what these lenders are able to get away with, as they have absolutely no incentive to try to work with borrowers to help them lower their payments. Even worse is that these lenders often encourage financially distressed/unemployed people to put their loans in forbearance during the period of hardship. This is actually beneficial for the lender--and very harmful to the borrower--because interest continues to accrue at an alarming rate. So this person who is unemployed or facing severe economic hardship, and is therefore unable to make timely loan payments, is doubly penalized because when their forbearance period inevitably runs out, they find themselves with a much higher total loan balance than they had before they were laid off/fell into tough financial situation.

I can not ford their minimum payment and since they have made it clear theydon't work with you I still make a huge sacrifice in giving them a huge chunk of my incomeevery month and that still not good enough for them....they are still the first call to mycell everyday and last before bed.

CFPB-2013-0004-5160,Michael,K,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender ingaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I started my design degree at CCA in 2001, young with dreaming eyes, trying to escape myhome town of Milwaukee looking for better opportunities. I took out as many loans as Icould to finish my college degree at CCA and to live in SF. The classes were sequential 1to 3 every semester, so I had to enroll every time in order to get my industrial designprerequisites satisfied. I went along and paid the full tuition of more than 15k asemester, including living expenses believing that I would make enough money upongraduating. That was probably the most stupid thing I believed in those years. When Igraduated in 2005, REDACTED demanded that I pay them $850/month. This was an interest onlypayment plan on the total principal of $120K. I couldn't pay it, let alone pay for my ownrent. I had no job and I was thriving at the lowest level of existence. I was shattered,any will I had was torn. I worked every freelance job I could get trying to start myown business, just making enough to live off of. But my student loans still called andharassed me if not they were on my head. In 2007 forebearance had exceeded, I got a job asa graphic designer, making 50K a year. I thought finally I can make a payment, but only$500 a month. I called REDACTED repeatly over and over, asking them for help andtelling them what I was able to do. NO ONE helped with friendly advice or any sort ofdirection. I felt lost, depressed, abandoned, it flooded into my personal life. I felt asif I wasn't good enough, I had FAILED. Even though I was highly successful in college, Iwasn't prepared for such an enormous financial burden. Loans went into default on/off,I missed payments and then REDACTED believed I really didn't have any money. I came ingood faith to REDACTED when I couldn't make a payment, but they wouldn't talk to me untilI missed the payment to negotiate something more reasonable. After December of 2009, 2out of 5 of my loans that were consolidated went to a private collector REDACTED (personalcollectors of REDACTED), I was making minimal payments of $200 while I was paying offfreelance taxes in trying to create my own business from 2005-2007, along with credit carddebt. I looked into Bankruptcy and they couldn't help me. They said I shouldn't havepaid off all my other debt and they could only freeze my loans and the interest wouldstill accrue. This terrified me, I couldn't let a swimming pool of more debt justcollect over my head to be poured and drown me in 3yrs. I would be worse off, I wouldrather scramble for my payment each month to try and stay a head of the crunchinginterest. Today 2012, 2 of my loans are in default and in collection 1 is federalthe other 2 are in good standing. My credit score is horrible. I can't get a loan tosettle the amount with the collection agency, since a bank won't approve one for me. But Isend REDACTED And REDACTED $735 a month, but it just keeps me steady. This only goes toINTEREST, AND $8.27 goes to my principal. This is HIGHWAY ROBBERY! This burden hashaunted me for 7yrs now, I have to get a job that makes at least 70K a year in order tomake any dent into that principal. It all feels gloomy and tragic, work harder to giveREDACTED more money. That's not a life worth living, there needs to be hope and somerelief, so that graduates can live a decent fulfilling life. I would rather give mymoney to my twin sister who needs it far more than I do. She is burden with medical bills,her house is being foreclosed soon, while her husband is recently laid off this year,supporting my 2 nieces, their water heater is broken. It's disgusting. I'm 32yrs oldthis weekend (March 18th 2012), and I wish the last 7yrs of my life didn't involve so muchfinancial struggle! And it's not the end, if I don't make more than 70K a year... I willnever pay off my student loans. Enslaved labor for a private education just doesn't seemfair when I could be doing better work, spending my money to help my family and grow abusiness and give back to my community. This crushed so many of my dreams and willingspirit, I can't even begin to tell you here. Something has to change, private lendingsectors for education should be controlled and bankruptcy should apply to people who aretrying to pay back their debt reasonably. It's NOT FAIR. Sincerely Michael Kuehl Mar2012 March 21st 2013 A year later, I'm still making payments to my student loans,nothing has changed on the principal and half my income went to student loans in 2012.All I'm doing is paying interest every year and there's no relief. I won't ever pay offthese loans the way this system is rigged. If I bought a home, I would know exactly howmany payments I would make, at an exact interest rate and amount that I would pay.

I have both REDACTED and government loans. They wanted over a third of my take home pay,BEFORE I paid a dime toward my federal loans. This amount is significantly more than theFederal government will even garnish if I default on my government loans, and since it's atotally separate debt the government can garnish on top of what REDACTED takes. REDACTEDtold me they took precedence because I could not write them off and because the feds wouldbe kinder to me in the long run than they ever would be. My credit is destroyed. I can'teven trade in my 12 year old car for a more reliable old used car, and they have told methey will take my car anyway if I don't pay them what they deem I need to pay them. But Ido get to keep a sewing machine and a Bible in that scenario. I am currently in anemergency program paying approximately $200 per month more than I told them I couldpossibly afford, and my parents are helping me make ends meet. I'm not able to pay on myfederal loans right now at all and I am terrified what will happen when the day comes thatI have to begin repayment there as well as try to swing a car payment and beg for acontinuance in the private loan program. I'm 39 years old and I have no savings, eithershort term or for retirement. I am in constant fear that something bad will happen and myhouse of cards will collapse. My ""loan balance"" for my private loans is double what Iactually borrowed thanks to their awful hardship recapitalization practices and theirrepeated threats over the years. If I was a bad credit risk, they never should have lentme the money. I didn't think I was a bad risk because they loaned me the money. I see nowthat I was and they had no underwriting practices in place because they didn't care; thegovernment was going to guarantee their loans if they defaulted. If they always intendedto prioritize themselves over my KNOWN Federal academic debt thanks to the swiss cheesetheir lobbyists made of the consumer protection laws, they should be punished for fraud,for intentionally trying to steal from the government by enticing otherwise unqualifiedloan candidates to overextend themselves egregiously so they could profit at everyone'sexpense. The government should NOT guarantee these loans, and if the situation isgenuinely bad enough, a borrower should be allowed at least to reorganize in bankruptcycourt, if not write the debt off completely. They have no written policies on hardshipagreements, no people to sit down with and meet in person to ask questions, and no longterm reduced payment solutions are offered. I was lied to when I took my private loans. Iwas told I could consolidate them, but they eliminated that program while I was in gradschool. Now if I am late, I pay not one but four late fees; one for each of the fourdisbursements I had. They double dip on fees in every possible way they can think todouble dip, then recapitalize the debt to turn their inflated fees into principal. I can'twrite them off so my credit will never improve, because I will never be able to pay theover $1,000 per month they prefer me to pay. in 8 months I have to go back to them againand beg, again by telephone, for a faceless person to arbitrarily ask me ""budget""questions and ""determine"" if I truly need a lower payment. Then they get to arbitrarilydecide how much I must pay, just like they did this year. I told them what I could afford.They ignored me. They said I could pay that amount but they would still put me intodefault and send the Sheriff. So my parents pay for my gas (which they can't afford to doand will not do indefinitely) so I can make it to work to pay the loan sharks the minimumthey are willing to take this year without reporting me to the credit reporting agencies.I am in perpetual financial limbo and I make ""good money"". I am the working poor, and Ihave health problems too. This stress is making them significantly worse. If I ever losemy job I don't know what I will do. This is not the American way. I worked hard my wholelife and I have nothing to show for it and no financial future to look forward to. Theysay welfare recipients have no incentive to work. No. I have no incentive to work, if I'mgoing to have nothing and be a deadbeat on paper no matter how much I try for the rest ofmy life. I have no incentive, other than my own moral compass, for being a productivecitizen because REDACTED holds the deed to my future and has no intention of ever lettingme buy it back. I live a quiet and simple life. I have never taken a vacation. Neverbought a new car. Will never have children and can never retire. I lost my house when Igot sick and that's when the REDACTED principal skyrocketed too. This isn't right.

At present, my student loan (which was consolidated, and I'm not sure if it's in a private student loan program) is on hold due to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

They told me there was only ONE option - to defer for a certain time period based on financial hardship, HOWEVER, if I do that, the consequence is that after the deferment period (which is 3, 6 or 12 months) the payments DOUBLE. I have 4 different private law loans (one for each year of school) which they refuse to consolidate) and thus I can't afford to have the payments double. The oldest loan is already $232/month for the payment! My stepdad used to pay $400/month toward the $670/month I owe, but when I got this Paralegal job I can pay all but $150.00/month. But, now my stepdad is aging and losing his memory and he keeps telling me he's already deposited the $150 into my account when he hasn't so the last 3 months I have been late on the payments because I've had to convince my Dad that he really did NOT make the deposit.

I'm asking for help for private loans. Loan forgiveness for years of service for the lawenforcement agencies like the FBI, lower interest rates, anything. At this point I'll takeanything any help. I need some relief for a single male working for the FBI making 34k a year. Thank youGod bless youDominic Perrin  ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-5297

Taking out these loans is the biggest regret of my life. I was not given proper information or opportunity to know the impact these loans would have on the rest of my life. I was deceived by the financial aid advisors at Columbia in a number of ways. I will have these debts for the rest of my life and they are having a huge impact on my and my family's quality of life. It is a source of great stress and worry for me. I did not know I could ask the lender to lower my payments. I'm not sure I would as it would probably mean even more interest. We make a good living and have to live very poorly because of these loans. I'll counsel my kids against making the same mistake I did. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? They are terrible. They are difficult to reach and keep you on hold forever. The customer service representatives are rude and not knowledgable. The only time they are quick to call is if you miss a payment. Then they call three or four times a day starting at 7:30 in the morning and during meal times. They harass you even after a payment is made because their internal communications are poor. I wish I could sell the loans to someone who would be better.                                                            ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-5303
CFPB-2013-0004-5304,mike,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. My private lender (Wells Fargo Collegiate) has been consistently unwilling to allow any change to loan terms or minimum payments. Additionally, they have been unwilling to allow any sort of unemployment or financial hardship deferrments -- the payment is automatically withdrawl from my account every month, and if I am unable to afford the payment I am forced to borrow money elsewhere to avoid defaulting on the loans. While my federal consolidation lender has been much more amiable bearable to work with in terms of financial hardships, between private and federal loans my monthly payment is equal to that of a mortgage or large car payment, which I am not able to afford because of said loans and financial hardship. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I would not recommend my private loan provider to *anyone*. Wells Fargo Collegiate (and Wells Fargo Bank, who I bank with solely for the small (.25%) decrease in interest rates on my loans) are consistently unprofessional (being told different things depending on who I speak with), having documents mailed to incorrect addresses, employees not following through with tasks they had committed to verbally, being charged new fees after speaking to several representatives who tell me that said fees do not apply to my situation. These are just a few examples of my general dissatisfaction, frustration, and exhaustion with my private loan provider.

They were nasty and unyielding, seeming to not understand that my life has changed in waysI could not have anticipated and cannot control. The private loans have gone tocollection. I have stopped even trying to talk to these people because they have literallyyelled and screamed at me that I am not trying hard enough to meet my obligations, that Iam a liar and a promise breaker, etc. After I sat and cried a few times, I just couldn'ttake care of my daughter and keep trying to talk to these people. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? I think REDACTED is the devil, frankly. No one you ever talk to has seemed to make noteson what you said the last time you talked to someone. Or maybe, they simply don't care. Ithink I'd kill myself if I had to work at a place like that. Unless they are naturallymean and nasty people, the morale must be horrible given the abusive nature of what theydo. I mean, I have almost killed myself over the years to pay those loans. Then mydaughter came early, spent four months in the hospital, and I haven't been able to worksince since she can't go to daycare with her issues. Even when I can work again, I amhopelessly behind and don't know if I'll ever be able to do the amount of work I was doingbefore she was born.

The loan is in my mom's name, so the companies will not even discuss the loan with me until she gives authorization. I'll try to make payments, but the loan will be sold to another company, and since the loan is in my mom's name, I won't even get any notification. She'll call me screaming around tax time, because they're threatening to take her refund, when all the while, I've been making payments to the wrong company. This has happened twice. I've had the loan rehabilitated at least twice, but whenever the company, payment or terms change, I don't know about it so it goes into default yet again. I also can't get a straight answer on the amount owed. My mom told me it was $29,000, the loan company told me it was $63,000, and yet other paperwork tells me it's $44,000.

I contacted my lender prior to the start of the pay period to inquire about any options to lower my payments, interest rate, or accrued interest. Multiple representatives told me that there are no options available and no one else I could speak with. Additionally I was told that my deferment option was used during my graduate studies. I took out the private student loan early in my undergraduate studies as my federal aid was insufficient. During my time in school the loan amount increased by more than 50 percent due to accrued interest. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? The representatives have always been amicable and professional, however they were not willing to consider any alternate repayment options. If I could offer advise to others I would recommend not attending post high school education if it would have required them to barrow from a private lender. I borrowed $18,000 and by the time I finished graduate school the accrued interest increased my total private student loan debt to over $56,000. The interest rates are very high compared to other consumer loans, yet the lender is guaranteed that the borrower cannot ever discharge the debt, so they have the upper hand in negotiations. I inquired into refinancing my private loan debt, but there are not any affordable options that I would qualify for.

Six months after I got out of school, I was able to land a six-month contract position. Ihoped I would be able to stay on but the client dropped the project. I called REDACTED &explained this to them. All the representatives said the only options I had to defer mypayment were to 1. go back to school or 2. pay a $50 dollar processing fee. This woulddefer my $400 dollar loan payment for three months. I have three loans with REDACTED. Thefees totaled $150. None of this amount would go to paying my loans because it is aprocessing fee. I thought this was unreasonable. They said it was the only way. I used myunemployment benefits check to pay this amount. My monthly unemployment check was about$700. If I payed the monthly fee, I would not have enough left for gas, food, rent & topay my phone (my lifeline when applying for work). I payed the $150 dollar fee everythree months for as long as I could. My unemployment benefits ran out. I still could notget a job. I told them this. They said pay the fee or go back to school. I sent a letterto the management fee. I received a 7 page letter explaining my options if I had agovernment subsidized loan & it had one paragraph explaining the options for privatestudent loans: go back to school or pay the fee. While job hunting I found out about astate program that pays for you to go back to school & learn a skill to fill jobs thatthere are not enough people to fill in the state. I finally got into this program after ayear or pursuing it. South Florida Workforce didn't want to let me in the program becauseI have a Bachelor degree. Now I'm studying web development because there are not enoughWeb Developers in Florida. I called REDACTED and told them I'm in school. Can they defermy payments now? They said no my loans are defaulted and transferred me to the collectionsdepartment. The representative there explained my only option is to pay the monthlypayment which is almost $500. I explained that I'm still unemployed. He said ""Your mom hasa good credit rating. Let me talk to her."" This was baffling. My mother lives of theSocial Security checks she receives every month and food stamps. I explained this to him.His response was that she can put it on her credit card. I said there is no way I'mletting you talk to my mother. She doesn't speak English and she is ill. He said theywould take me to court. I called REDACTED back & told them what their collections agencyhad done. Every time I speak with them they are completely unreasonable. Even when I dofind a job, which looks I'll be earning less than before I went back to school, I won'tever be done paying these loans. I went to school so that I could get a job where Icould have retirement savings and hopefully buy my own home. A job where I could afford togo on vacation once a year and still have money to pay my bills and be debt free. Now Ifeel like I was such a fool to think any of that could ever happen. I feel like I shouldof seen this coming. I knew that in Miami, FL there were way too many people taking loansthey couldn't pay & banks giving loans out that were outrageous & irresponsible. But Ithought the banks knew what they were doing. I never thought there would be this crazyjobs crisis. And now I'm never going to even be debt free. I feel a little trapped becauseI can't find a job and they way my loans are going I don't think I'll be able to pay themoff. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? Before I applied for any private student loan in 2007. I asked about the rates, conditionsand fees. They said they could not predict or release any of this information until Iapplied for the loan. So I applied for loans when I thought the fees & rates were toohigh and the conditions too restrictive. I applied for a loan from a different bank. Theyall had the same interest, rates and conditions. I thought this was weird since they allsaid it was all so unpredictable and changed on a daily basis. So I went with REDACTED.During the loan application they were very professional. When I started having problemspaying, they were so unprofessional and difficult to work with.

I have private loans through Sallie Mae and Discover Student Loans. It does not matter if I have been making $30,000 a year or $3,000 a year. They have made no accommodations or exceptions in payment regarding my income. All of my money goes to loans either way. I cannot afford health insurance because I must pay these loans no matter what. I have never defaulted. My federal loans are the complete opposite. They are flexible and reasonable. I wish I could repay the federal loans first as they are run with care and integrity. Private loan companies dictate their customers' lives. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I would say that they are professional for their industry. I have nothing positive to say about their willingness to accommodate financial difficulty.

Depending on the rep you talk to, they can be kind or they can be cold and uncompromising.My loans were in an automatic payment plan, and somehow between REDACTED & REDACTED,an automatic payment broke in November. I didn't realize anything was wrong, but I thoughtit was strange when I had a $6 (instead of $768) payment due in December. I paid itmanually, then come January ( a month later) my loans were suddenly 3 months behind?If I hadn't made the $6 payment, there would have been NO record of ANY error, and I wouldhave appeared to be just another ""deadbeat"" who couldn't pay, instead of the regularpaying customer whose account encountered technical issues. When I called in terrifiedand crying due to +$2,000 I didn't have being demanded out of nowhere IMMEDIATELY, I hadthe fortune to connect to a rep who actually seemed to care and wanted to help. Shewas ""unfortunately unable"" to restore my previous payment amount of $768/month, andinformed me the absolute lowest payment she could calculate (and admittedly, we went backand forth for a few minutes trying different numbers and scenarios) was $1,134/month, anadditional +$366 to what I had been paying, and this STILL wouldn't begin to touch theprincipal, but would just barely cover the interest. She encouraged me to attempt topay anything OVER the $1,134 that I could, because in the 1% program she had placed me in(that required 3 qualifying payments), all my loans only incur 1% interest for the year,(instead of the 2.8%-6.8% between my various loans) and all payments (THIS YEAR ONLY)apply to my principal. A great incentive to pay extra, if you can find the money. Thefollowing week I lost my job, boss told me he couldn't afford a graphic designer AND themortgage payments on the $1.5million addition he'd put on his house. Business was slow,and his wife had been watching me work so they figured they had it covered, and didn'tneed me anymore (after 3 years with the company). I called my rep, and she encouragedme to do my best to make the payments, otherwise I would be removed from the 1% program,my payments would go up to $1,500/month and I would be ineligible to apply to the programagain for 1 year. Now it's 8 weeks later and I have occasional freelance work, but noweekly paycheck, so I've been considering taking an internship with a company I've workedwith before (even though their rate of pay would equal out to LESS than I received onunemployment). I've had incredible difficulty landing another design position, despite mywell designed resume, +8 years experience and a nice portfolio. Just don't know what'sleft to do when you feel like you've done ALL THE THINGS. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? REDACTED on the whole is cold, and enormous. Too big to keep track of all it's internalprocesses, people's lives can be destroyed with one errant keystroke. While I can't faultthem for predatory lending practices, I can't see how they expect to make largeinvestments in unstable accounts, and expect their business to keep rolling. You don'tusually see $100,000 in small business loans being handed to someone who's got an idea foreye gunk removal, or a $100,000 home loan being handed to someone who makes $12,000 a yearworking in fast food. Nope, just give it to teenagers who want to go to school somewherebesides their crummy local community college and parents who don't want to destroy theirkid's dreams just because their pockets aren't deep enough.

I tried on multiple occasions to negotiate with Sallie Mae, ACS and AES after I lost my job and had to take a much lower paying job. I used all of my deferment and forbearance.

Private loan is a consolidation loan co-signed with my mother. When I started repayment Iwasn't working so made interest only payments (lowest they could offer, still $200 amonth). They said these would count towards co-signer release, but 7 months in Idiscovered they'd been lying. Not only did interest only payments not count, but I'ddisqualified the loan from ever releasing the co-signer - the rule (which I was never toldor shown, despite requesting a copy of the info in writing) is that only the first 24payments count. In other words, the time when you're least likely to be able to make fullpayments. At the moment I'm trying to get my 2 years of full payments in, despite it beingdifficult, because I'm still going to try to get my mom's name off te loan. It probablywon't work but I have to try. I never would have consolidated all my private loans if I'dknown my mom would be tied to them forever. Even if they won't take her name off, I wishthe private loans could go on the income based repayment plan - my federal loans are onthat plan now, but total federal + private loan payments eat about a third of my monthlyincome after tax.

Initially, my student loan was $62,000 @ 9% int. I developed stage 3 breast cancer, couldn't work. My husband used the equity in my home to pay off his debts and abandoned my daughter and me. That was in 1994. In 1998, I was still struggling, so upon the advice of an attorney (who was certain I could have the loan discharged), I declared bankruptcy. At first, they said they could not do so. But then, I received a letter in 2000 saying my loan was discharged. In 2001, injured at work, I had a laminectomy (L-4 & 5) and returned to FL since I could no longer work in my occupation at 47% disability (unable to sit for prolonged periods in order to see patients). I remarried. In 2004, when I applied for a FHA Home loan, the student loan people said I still owed them the money, plus interest ($120,000). By then, my new husband had developed stage 4 cancer. I had used all of my resources to keep him alive. I have consistently been unable to pay this student loan for documented reasons yet, the Student Loan people continue to hound me, year after year. I am 65 years of age. I am unable to work due to a severe auto-immune reaction to a genetically- modified compound that I was exposed to and that has attacked my system due to my continuing low immune system. I receive less than $800 social security (due to having to quit work to care FT for my former husband), $29 per month from CalStrs teacher retirement and $447 from the State of CA CalPers program. It is beyond unbelievable that the student loan people continue to do this, making my life a living hell every time they reassert themselves in my life.

When my payments were $1200 a month, only paid forbearance was an option while unemployed; interest still accumulated. After I exhausted forbearance and could not pay and nearly went into default they put me on a special repayment plan with reduced interest rates that were still quite high.

My monthly payments are low and that is not my problem. My problem is the interest rate-its simply too high! While I was in college I was accumulating interest charges and onceI was done with school I owed an extra $2k to $3k JUST on interest. Since I graduated in2010, I've been paying double my minimum amount due and I am barely going to startchipping away at the amount that I actually borrowed. For years, I've only been paying offthe interest that was accumulated. I feel so betrayed by REDACTED. I've tried to lower myinterest rate since I have never missed a payment and rarely pay the minimum, but theywould not budge. I am stuck with my interest rate. I wish there was some way to regulateprivate student loans and put a cap on the amount of interest charges being accumulatedwhile a student is in school and unable to pay back a loan. It should be like oursubsidized loans. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? My private loan provider is REDACTED and after this private loan I am never doing businesswith them again. Ever! If they cant work something out for someone like me who has NEVERmissed a payment, has never been late with a payment and almost always pays double or moreof the minimum due, then I cant imagine how difficult they must be with people who cantafford their minimum due. While their personnel is friendly, they are difficult and try toguilt trip me for taking out the loan in the first place. Sorry for being poor and wantinga higher education, REDACTED!

We were on Welfare during college and for a little while right after. University stopped giving engineering licenses with diploma during our year, so lots of doors closed. Best work I could get was in bill collection. Spouse became Disabled and went on SSDI, unable to hold a normal job or normal hours. My loans originally were 70,000$. We were on multiple deferments year after year, until they sold our loans to Aspire. Now we don't qualify for most General Economic Distress Deferments and the Interest on our loans alone is over 1000$ per month. I make about 1200$ take home a month. We filed for Bankruptcy about nine years ago, wiped out everything but the student loans. The lawyer wouldn't even try to get those dismissed. Now they are in excess of 160,000$. Aspire lies to us about what program we need to do paperwork for to get the lowest payment per month. There are policies in place now that make it impossible to get my spouse's loans discharged, even though she is on Disability and unable to work. Unless she will die within the next year and a doctor will sign off on that, the loans stay. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

Even though I nevermentioned bankruptcy, I was reminded by REDACTED that filing bankruptcy would be futilebecause private loans aren't dis-chargeable and I would be better served giving my moneyto them rather than a bankruptcy attorney if I was considering taking that course ofaction. When taking advantage of the ONE TIME interest-only for one year payment option,my servicer REDACTED allegedly ""misplaced"" my application on four different occasionswhile telling me it was in processing whenever I called them.

I had to show them my other loans for them to even consider dropping my payments...they would NOT consider my monthly payments to my credit cards, my car insurance or even my car payments, not to mention any of my other bills. In other words, they did not seem to truly care about making it more affordable for me, causing me to be seriously limited in my funds such that I only have approximately 100 dollars a month for unforseen expenses. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I would consider them to be what they are, a business. As such, their first priority is money, we are just $$$$ to them.

When the first payment was due I called to learn my options and the only available were... standard repayment.. 1900 a month. Extended repayment... 1500 a month and interest only 1300 a month. I was shocked, asked for further options and there were none. I choose interest only with a combination of forbearances on specific loans. I was able to get by until I got more steady work. Now I'm still only paying interest only 4 years later, but at least I can make the payments without family assistance or forbearance. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? They were very difficult to work with because it was either their options or nothing. Kinda like talking with a computer.

This make is difficult to keep track of theamount of the monthly payments and is the basis for the false reporting to the creditbureaus. I attempted to correct the false reporting with REDACTED, but they was veryunprofessional in both the amount of time it took to hear back from them and in theirreponse. Despite the fact I have no payments due for two years and have never been lateon a single monthly payment, their one line response was that I had delinquencies.

If only my payments could be lowered to a manageable amount, I would pay my student loans back without hesitation. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

CFPB-2013-0004-5551,nicole,c,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I recently contacted my loan provider because I kept seeing charges for a late payment. This was odd to me, as I make my payments on time every month and their online system was reflective of that. So, I contacted them to discuss these charges. They, then, proceeded to tell me (After much questioning and circular responses) that these were because every month I was owing on the interest for each loan. I, then asked them why they don't reflect these charges then, as an interest charge and not as a late charge. They could not provide me with an answer. I then asked them what was the total owed interest at this point, so that I would not continue to get additional charges every month on top of the regular payment due. Their response to me was ""Oh, mam it is too much, it is a big amount"". This made me very upset because I just wanted a dollar amount but it seemed that they did not want to give it to me and wanted me to be in this vicious loop where I was paying them money that was not going towards my interest or towards the principal but rather into their pockets. I informed the woman that I would determine whether that amount was too much or not. After arguing some more, she finally told me the amount, which I then paid off with the hopes that my monthly statements will go back to what they are supposed to be (a fixed amount every month where I am paying towards interest and principal). We will see if this is the case, as I have not received the statement yet but I am concerned that they will find an additional way to sneak in hidden costs.

One, this survey could use some design and methodology work / refinement. Two, if this is about student loans and repayment, then I think it's missing some of the biggest problems: a) interest rates, in that who cares about lowering a payment if your interest rate is high; you'll never escape your loan if you don't pay back substantially, and b) the delay between graduation and gainful employment as a professional in the job market for which you've been studying.

And currently have a PT job at $9/hr and have not had a raise since I began the job. Since then, I think I received a call in 2011 asking me for my private info i.e. DOB, SS#, etc. I told them before I give out that form of info I'd have to know who they were but they would not identify themselves; so I gave out no info. Even a federal loan offices identify themselves and the nature of the call! So I told the caller/representative if they wanted any private info from me I first need to know who they are.

I attended college for 5 years. Each semester I had to take out a private loan to offsetthe cost. REDACTED made it very easy and told me I would be able to consolidate the loansonce I graduated. When I graduated, REDACTED reported that I had 10 different loans. Icalled to consolidate and they said they no longer consolidated private loans. I startedpaying $350.00/month. Suddenly I started receiving notices that I was delinquent. My momhad co-signed and she called and called REDACTED to try and find out what the problem was.Every time she called the person said...""Oh just send in $350.00 and shr will be caughtup"". After doing this repeatedly and paying over $5,000.00, we were still receivingdelinquint notices. It was impossible to get through to anyone who could advise us whatthe problem was. Finally, we figured out that REDACTED was only putting payment on oneloan at a time instead of spreading it over the 10 loans...which the representatives saidwas happening. When we finally figured it out, I started getting notices that the loanhad been sold or given to a collection agency. I was still paying the $352.00 per month.I started receiving collection notices from different agencies and REDACTED and nowthings were really confused. I didn't know who to pay and what I owed. My mom has goneto the bank, accountants and lawyers and no one can figure out what I owe or who to pay.The last call to REDACTED they said I had to pay at least 300.00 per loan permonth...$3000.00/month...that is impossible.

I tried talking with my lender REDACTED which alone cost me $14 to talk to a real personon the phone rather than a robot. I tried to lower my interest rates, but I was told thatthere was no way I could do this, even with on time payments and paying more than theminimums. I attempted to refinance my loans through either a different bank or creditunion, but I was told the only way to do that is put up collateral such as a mortgage on ahouse or another large piece of property, which i have none of. The only thing I can do tolower my payments is to extend the life of the loan; however, if I do that, the amount Iend up paying will cost me more than owning 2 or 3 median size houses due to theexorbitant interest rates. These rates are ridiculous, especially since when I firstsigned up, they were about 7% and now are over 9%. This is at a time when interest ratesare at record lows. Unfortunately, I don't have a chance at all to lower those paymentswithout costing me much much more in the long run. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? I consider REDACTED a financial predator that thrives on the naive high school and collegestudents that do not really know how interest rates work or how compounding interestworks. The fact that they charge additional fees to talk to them on top of alreadyincredibly high payments is an abhorrent way to squeeze every penny out of someone andmake it difficult to even contact them. One example is that their website was down and Icouldn't make a payment. I then had to call, pay a fee to talk to someone, and then gotcharged another fee to pay my bills. On top of that, even when you pay online, it takes2-4 business day to process. In order to pay on time, one must pay several days inadvance, even when this is done online. If you want to pay the same day, or even 1 dayahead of schedule, you can do so for a fee. This service is also randomly unavailable soyou can end up being forced to make a late payment, even when you are on time and try topay. The people on the phone are typically nice enough and professional, but the companypolicies and fees are financially cruel and unfair. They are evil in my opinion and asymbol of all that is wrong with our current banking system.  ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-5743

CFPB-2013-0004-5754,Maria,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender ingaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. When I was unemployed, REDACTED refused to allow me to cease payments unless I paid $150to place my loans on forbearance for 90 days. I couldn't understand how they expected meto be able to afford $150 every three months to place my loans in forbearance if I wasunemployed. I asked to negotiate monthly payments upon employment and the only option theyoffered me was interest-only, which is essentially a monthly fee to keep me defaulting onmy loans. It does not have any significant impact on the amount of money I owe. My studentloans have cause me to regret attending college. If I'd known the US economy would beunfit for college graduates in 2008, I would've opted not to go to college straight out ofhigh school in 2004. My frustrations with my student loans have made me consider moving toa country that does not seek to capitalize off of higher education so that my children cango to college for free and/or for an affordable price. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? REDACTED has been extremely difficult to work with. The representatives often don'tunderstand nor speak English very well. The ""alternative"" options they offer areunaccommodating and are worse off than your initial option. REDACTED will make adjustmentsto your account without notifying you first. If you're late on a payment, they willimmediately contact your co-signer(s) as opposed to contacting you first. As an 18year-old kid, I had no idea that attaining a REDACTED loan was essentially signing acontrat to destroy my life after college. I would've had a better life had I not attendedcollege immediately after high school and simply chosen to be debt free.  ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-5754

I still have 6 months of this deferment left, which Iam saving for a serious emergency. I have paid my loans on time, yet it has been a serioushardship given my income level, and I find myself having to forgo basic necessities tomeet the monthly payments. I am terrified by what might happen if I am unemployed or illfor an extended period of time and am unable to make payments -- both my cosigner and Iwill be detrimentally affected.

I am unemployed and they wanted me to pay $50 a month per 3 private loans to defer for the allowable 3 times. They would not consider income sensitive because self employed. The loans were charged of down to $7000 from $50-60,000 and then sold to collectors who added another 25% penalty and interest and fees and I believe the last statement from them was over $88,000. They know I am 59 years old and will be on Social Security in 3 years and wanted me to make payment of $1600 and more a month. They also know I have almost $70,000 in Federal loans in deferment right now that I would be paying over $1000 a month for , if employed. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I have had reps say things to me about being a deadbeat and living beyond my means and how they would attach property and continue to add to the debt until paid. I finally had to request that they only communicate thru mail. I had to file bankruptcy during my final in school internship which was unpaid and the job I was supposed to have with hospice was cut by federal funding in 2008, so no job was there. I would send $50-$100 a month but they would still consider me delinquent and report as such (both private and federal). I told them to go ahead and sue me so I could get on with my life.

They want me to pay much more not less. I'm currently only able to afford the interest payments. No principal is ever reduced. In fact, the original loan was for $19,000. I believe I have paid that amount back at least 3 times over. I've paid over $24,000 in interest payments in the last 12 years, and nothing has come off of the principal or the fees and penalties that the Dept. of Education has added over the years!

CFPB-2013-0004-5845,Rachael,M,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. In October 2010, as the end of my grace period rapidly approached and I had no job at the time, I contacted Sallie Mae for their deferment options. Their ""option"" was to pay approximately two-hundred bucks to suspend payments for three months. While interest continued generating. There were no other options. Fortunately, a few weeks after that call, I secured part-time employment at Target where I made just enough to pay the monthly minimum for Sallie Mae. However, my situation in 2013 is vastly different; I now have a full-time job with a steady income capable of paying both my private and federal loans. So for question 16, the following one, currently the payments from Sallie Mae are affordable but, had I not found better employment, I would consider them very distressing. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? Sallie Mae is unreasonable with repayment options and can try to sneak in fees for no apparent reason, so I have to stay vigilant in monitoring the statements. However, they have been very fair when called out on their activities and have reversed every fee I've noticed, as well as quickly correcting misapplied check payments. This is far more than what I can say for fedloans, my federal student loan provider post-consolidation, who have outpaced Sallie Mae by being both uncompromising, incompetent, and unfair.

The lender's representative used a harsh, bullying approach and called me two or three times a week.

I had to contact the Bursar's Office at San Francisco State University, and I verified that the university did not want to cause me hardship and was quite willing to accept monthly payment.

CFPB-2013-0004-5871,Rachael,T,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. A few years ago I was unable to make payments on my loans. I received multiple calls and messages most days reminding me to make a payment. I called the loan provider and let them know I was not able to make the payment that month but would would try to make the payment the following month and asked if they could stop calling me. I was told they had no control over the incessant calls, which continued. After a few months of struggling financially, I spoke to them about loan forbearance. I was told to bring my loan current, then submit the application (including a processing fee) through their website. They would take 5 days to review then notify me. I was able to bring my loan current with some difficulty, and submitted my request. After 5 days, I checked back and was pleased to see that my next payment was not due for another six months. Two months later I received notification that my loan payments were late. When I followed up and told them that it was in forbearance, I was told that my forbearance had been revoked because I didn't use the correct form for my forbearance request, and they didn't catch the mistake until after they had approved my forbearance. I explained that I had been directed to submit the request through their website, and there was only one forbearance request form on the site. They acknowledged their mistake with that and with not notifying me within the five day window, but said I would need to resubmit my request. I had to bring my loan current again, including the penalties for late payments for the loan that, last I had been notified had been in forbearance, and pay the processing fee once again. Thankfully, these days I am in a better financial position, and have decided to pay my loan off as quickly as I can so I no longer have to deal with a company that puts profit over the well-being of its clients. To give a little perspective, at the same time I was dealing with this private student loan, I was also having problems with my federal loans. After I had missed two payments, I received a letter saying they had noticed I had missed payments and may be having financial difficulties. They included a forbearance request form and encourage me to fill it out if I needed help. I did not have to bring my loan current, and was approved for a longer forbearance than I had requested. The whole experience was quick and easy, the complete opposite of my experience with the private lender. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? My impression is that private loan providers are only interested in profit. Harassing phone calls, providing wrong information to clients, being unwilling to fix their own mistakes, let alone actually try and assist someone who is struggling, all clearly reveal a company that does not care about the people to whom they lend money - only the money itself. In my interactions with personnel, they were professional for the most part, but not very willing or able to work with me.

My husband lost his job around the time I was starting Phoenix University for my Bachelors. About 6 mos in I had to stop. I didn't have extra money to pay the loans and I didn't know how to defer the payments. Needless to say my credit is shot. Part of the issue was that there were several different loans and I was confused on who I owed what. They kept switching lenders. Starting last November I began making payments on one loan. Now I'm able to pay on all three. My original payment for the last loan was $333.00. I finally was able to talk them into 250.00 per month. I now am paying $440.00 a month total for all loans.

I was a volunteer in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, a year-long service program for young adults. I was able to defer my federal loans but was unable to defer or forebear my private loans. I was only receiving a small stipend and was involved in work for justice and equality in our society, and yet I almost had to leave my program because I was forced to make student loan payments to a private company.

I've never had a late payment or missed a payment in almost 5 years, yet REDACTED refusesto release my cosigner even though I have met and exceeded their published requirementsand have done so for twice as long as they require. They refuse to provide further detailon the underwriting requirements that I must meet in order to release my co-signer. Thelast time I tried contacting them for more information, I was told that I should apply fora mortgage to ""better prove"" my ability to handle my debt load, which I'm pretty sure isillegal advice, not to mention completely irresponsible and basically a disaster in themaking. I am afraid that if I continue to apply for cosigner release, it will reduce myown credit score, which I have worked so hard to build up to an excellent level. I havesince given up on releasing my cosigner, and it continues to drag down the creditworthiness of this person. Recently they had extreme difficulty in obtaining a mortgagebecause of my debt, even though I pay everything on time every month and have never askedfor a deferment or forbearance. I was forced to submit documentation showing the origin ofevery single payment I've ever made to REDACTED to prove that it was from my own incomestream, so naturally I feel like I will never be able to get a mortgage of my own eventhough my husband has excellent credit as well and a much lighter debt load.

Since, I obtained my 3 degrees. There were times where I could not afford the payments, due to unemployment or not making enough money to make the payments. So, I have exhausted all of my deferement/forbereance. I have never defaulted in my student loans when I was making payments. I am a single parent of one child and I wanted to make something of myself by obtaining these degrees. Every company that I applied with either told me, one of the following: not enough experience, need a higher level degree or overqualified. I never said, I did not want to pay the student loans back, but it is hard to do when you can not get the job to pay them back. Please look at the unemployed rate in South Carolina, they claim that there are jobs out there for us. If noone gives us a chance to prove that we are a right fit, then how would they know.

My student loan provider for private loans is REDACTED, a few months ago I was taken off areduced payment plan and returned to the full amount of the payment. I am currentlyunemployed and have been for several months. I called in immediately when I realized thatmy payment was going up. I was directed to several different people all who told me that Icould not do anything about preventing the payment from going up until after it was dueand I would be late for the payment. I didn't believe this at first so I called again. Iwas told the same thing, and I was also told that I should let them default because thecreditor for defaulted loans was more inclined to work with me over REDACTED.""What!?!?!?,"" I thought to myself. Of course I don't want to have my loans go into defaultbecause of the disaster it would have on my credit report. I called in again, begging forhelp, after over an hour of talking and being told that there was nothing they could do tohelp, I was transferred to her supervisor. After another hour long conversation about howshe could do nothing and that her supervisor would refuse to talk to me, after she pulledmy credit report without my consent, she told me I should ""pay only certain loans everyother month, and pay the remaining loans on the months in between because they won't beginto default until 45 days"". However, she then proceeded to tell me that there was no way toselect which loans the payment was applied to. After I exclaimed how ridiculous the advicethat she was giving me was, she simply said ""well we have come to a point where we willjust have to agree to disagree"" and hung up on me. Several weeks later, I called in again,with my cosigners this time. I actually got someone who took the time to explain what wasgoing on with my loans and why everyone else had told me ""no"" or suggested that I sabotagemy credit report. He was finally able to help me reduce the monthly payment for the next15 months down to $648, from $835 by reducing the interest rate on all of my loans down to3%.

While there were many payment plans available to me when Ioriginated my private loans between 2004 and 2008, all of those options have since beenterminated, and my only options are to go into default or make the payments.

As a Peace Corps Volunteer, I cannot pay the $250 a month payments on my loans. I have a 6 month grace period (I am in a Masters International program and was enrolled full time fall 2012 while serving abroad) that will end in August. For my private loans, I can use some of my relocation allowance from Peace Corps (which means I will have less relocation allowance when I complete my service) and need to rely on support from family who cannot truly afford the extra expense. It will be more difficult when I leave Peace Corps, because I will be looking for a job and will have these payments to deal with while being unemployed. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I think they are professional, but they're not flexible at all. Financial hardship deferments are only for two months and interest still grows during this period.

My payment on this loan is only $33 a month. There have been times, however, when I couldn't even make that. This lender is very difficult to work with. Even if I had emailed them regarding my past-due account they would call my family to try to get a hold of me. They even lied to my family telling them that they could not take them off the robocalls and that they must continue to call.

Have worked out a deal w/ one lender. Others I make payments well below the requsted monthly payments and the loans remain in default.

Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? Initially they were relentless, but over the years as the loans have gone further and further into default, they were more accepting in taking whatever I can give them. However we both know that they will never be paid off at the rate I am paying them currently. I have multiple loan companies. Some are better than others.                                                            ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-5974

I have a graduated payment plan, and in the past had to negotiate. At the time, they worked with me but the last time I negotiated (2009) I was told that in 2 years when my rate went up to the final level it would no longer be negotiable. In other words, during the initial 'levels' of my repayment plan, I talked them down to amounts I could afford. Now I'm at the top/max/last level and the amount is higher of course than if I'd paid the appropriate amounts in the past. I have not tried to change it because we can make the payments, barely, and I don't want to drag out the repayment process for any more years than I have to. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? To be honest I completely avoid dealing with them. I am so stressed/depressed by our (mine and my husband's) finances that I let him manage the bills so that it doesn't get me down.

Luckily with lower interest rates for variable loans over the passed 5 years I made out OK (very lucky to be at 4% and not 11%). If the economy were better and interest rates higher I would be sunk. A suggestion: If students could be exempt from say, 50% of their federal taxes that would be automatically applied to loan debt for the first 3-5 years out of school, I think that small investment from the government would pay out huge dividends in regards to young professionals buying power and stability. Of course better state/federal funding should drive the tuition cost down, but I don't see any schools lowering tuition rates anytime soon.

REDACTED has caps on how long you can be on forbearance and every time you renew it theymake you pay $100. If you can't even afford the $100 they pretty much refuse to work withyou and they will continue to bombard your phone and credit report until you can.REDACTED is not as bad but I have a co-signer and so outside of a few months offorbearance with them I haven't really done much with them.

How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith?

They are abusive and unrelenting to the economicsituations faced by recent college grads but more so to those, like me, who graduatedright after the market crash of 2008. Another practice that I find appalling is some ofthem offering a no-doc sub-prime loan to college students who lack knowledge of such loanpractices as well as the workings of the personal financial industry.

CFPB-2013-0004-6045,S.,D,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. My initial payments, back in 1994, were supposed to be $600 a month, which is laughable given I made under national poverty level for years, cobbling together work where I could either find or create it (with an MA degree). At some point the payments went down to ~300/month after falling in and out of default. My loans were also sold numerous times, and each time the situation became a little worse. To say I struggled would be a gross understatement. Eventually, only about 5 years ago, I got lowered payments (and consider, I graduated from my last school in 1993, almost 20 years ago). My issue now is that despite paying on these loans fairly consistently for almost 20 years, the principle has gone down LESS THAN $10,000. I don't want a free education. I attended college with the understanding I would pay for it; that is not the issue, which is why I worked THREE pt jobs while an undergraduate. The issue is that, b/c of interest fluctuations, my debt has lowered an absolutely miniscule amount in TWENTY years. I still owe over $40,000 on an initial $53,000 debt. (Have I mentioned I've been paying on it for TWENTY years?) It's bewildering and disgusting. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

In addition, the actual payment ends up going nearly all to interest (from a $200 payment, about $2 was applied to principal) - so by only making the minimum payments, my total debt has actually increased after nearly 3 years of on-time payments.

CFPB-2013-0004-6079,Rebecca,P,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. They are willing, admittedly, but when it comes to the options there just aren't any that are more than a bandaid solution and won't backfire later on--at least as they are described by my lender. The only option I even remotely qualify for is an income-based repayment options, but I have been told that choosing it will lock me into larger payments after a specific time has passed (about two years). As there's no guarantee I'll be able to increase my payments over time it seems short-sighted to opt for something that relieves me now but could very easily leave me in a much, much worse position just a short step down the row if life backfires as it's prone to do. Beyond that, there's just nothing they can, or are willing, to do for me. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I'd say both, really. On the one hand, I knew what I was signing up for when I signed it--or thought I did. On the other, most of the management avenues I was told would be there to help me deal with this when it was time (Re: after college) were no longer being offered by anyone by the time I graduated, and that has left me unexpected financial stress. It would be easier if my loan provider would agree to consolidate all of the loans that they own into a single loan with a single interest rate--but they won't. Of course, these are the private loans and it's unreasonable to try and dictate their business practices, even if I do think that one to be particularly unfair. However, I do not appreciate the fact that being even a day late will result in unrelenting phone calls at unreasonable hours( as early as six am, as late as eleven pm )--not only to me, but to the person who cosigned for one of my loans as well. That I find to be distinctly unprofessional.                                                            ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-6079

Establishing deferment eligibility when I started graduate school was quite difficult. My original lender was unwilling to allow deferment despite my status as a full-time student. They did, however, agree to allow me to make interest only payments. When my loans were eventually bought by another company, the new lender has been much more responsive and helpful. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? My first provider was very unprofessional. I had numerous problems with the company and the personnel even before I started graduate school. Payments were frequently credited to the wrong account and personnel were discourteous when I would call to correct the issue. I would send in the payments on time and with the enclosed account slips, but they would end up going to some other account. Personnel would always blame me for the issue and tell me that if I just gave them access to my bank account instead of sending in a payment manually each month that there would be no problems. That option seemed ridiculous to me considering that they couldn't properly handle the payments I was sending. If I had allowed them access to my accounts I'm almost certain the problems would have continued and I would have ended up with no money in my account. My personal bank account representatives frequently made three way calls with me to the loan company in order to verify that payments had been withdrawn from my bank account. This happened nearly every month for a year, and I have to say that once is an oversight, twice is problematic but three or more times is just straight up negligence and fraud. The company was mishandling funds transferred across state lines (wire fraud) and trying to charge me late fees for their screw ups. They damaged my credit and frustrated my life for several years. Luckily, since my loan provider has changed I have had a much better experience. The new company is very responsive both on the phone and by email, which is extremely convenient. I remain cautious when dealing with them, however, because they have so extensively mismanaged my father's mortgage account and I know that they are under investigation by at least one state's attorney general as a result of their mortgage loan problems.

The first year out of college I had to defer my payments entirely because I could not afford to pay them as I was not full-time employed.

They will act allsweet, talk nice, tell me they have options for me, and when they realize there are nooptions for me (because all the options require a payout of money from me) theconversation from there varies by individual. Some people (the minority) will beunderstanding and let the conversation end. Most will try to keep me on the line,becoming increasingly hostile as they fish for resources in the hopes I might have accessto someone else's money to pay the debt.

I have consolidated my loans and extended my repayment period to 30 years but my payments are still close to $700 a month.

Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with?

When I asked what payment options were possible they told me the only thing I could do was pay interest only payments (at $200 a month) or higher. End of story. Then, even if I took the interest only payment option, at the end of two years I would be required to start paying more, or I would default. When that date comes around I will try negotiating to shrink my interest percentage, (and hope the ""good faith"" payments I've made the past two years will work in my favor). If that does not work, or help my situation, I can do nothing but default. I cannot pay more. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

My husband was unemployed and I am currently underemployed. It is amazing how quickly life spiraled out of control. We have one car that is 17 years old, no cable, no internet, no smart phones, no vacation, and I still can't afford rent/insurance/food and the student loan payments. I have tried to defer, which requires a mountain our paperwork and time... EVERY time they lost my paperwork and I found out AFTER I got collection calls... They are abusive when you try to work out payment plans and have even made a remark about how my loans are graduate loans and further implied with a graduate degree I should have a good enough job to make my loan payments... combined my payments are $750 a month, and for a family of 4 with an annual gross of 38,000 it is impossible and yet. Every conversation is humiliating, and a constant reminder of my financial failure. What I would like to tell the people who work there, is that they are only a missed paycheck or two away from being in my shoes... I don't mind doing without, but I hate the things my kids miss out on. I would LOVE to have another child, but there is no way I can with my student loan payments. I am 33 and I really, REALLY worry that by the time the financial mess is settled down and either Washington helps with student debt or I can afford it, I will be too old to physically have another baby.

My payments jumped to $500 a month, and the lender can't do anything to help unless I pay off what I owe so far and fill out paperwork they say they will send. I can't fork out $500 and still pay my rent. The paperwork never arrives, but it doesn't stop them from auto-calling me three times a day to remind me I owe them money. I'm a freelancer without reliable pay, constantly trying to get work, and these calls are so upsetting I hardly answer my phone anymore. It's extremely depressing and I've pretty much given up on the idea of being able to pay off my debt, let alone save money, invest in my own future (which is what I thought I was doing by getting an education), or feel like a free person.

I've had deferments How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? It was all done through the school's financial aid office. Just filled out the applications and mailed them in. Since I was still in school, never had to talk to them until I graduated and consolidated. Then, I did deferments through the mail and that was that. No counseling about the huge financial implications and responsibilities. Now that I know better about interest rates, its was a ridiculously high one and had no idea how it would financially cripple me. When I consolidated, they explained about deferments but didn't realize it'd be like buying a big house when I didn't even have a job. Since it was guaranteed, they knew they'd get their money back so they didn't spend too much time explaining, warning or guiding. Now I get what a ""student"" loan means: The longer lasting lesson I learned from my higher education experience. Business interests should stay away during the ""student"" phase and leave that to the institutions themselves with some government help. Once a student has graduated and is on some kind of a career track with an income stream, that student will definitely become a more ""secure"" consumer and thus a better client to a variety of financial institutions. To saddle a student with school loans before a career track or steady income, severely handicaps the student's future and his role in his community. That's what's happened to me. Through deferments, a $35k loan has ballooned to over $110K. Five years after I consolidated, I was able to make payments. That job ended three years later and making payments since then is so much harder because they're higher and my income has not kept pace. Its a vicious cycle that I just don't know how I will ever get out of it.

Really, i'd be happy being able to consolidate all mine and my wife's student loans into one loan with one payment and one call center to deal with. Doing so would make it easier to track and manage (for obvious reasons); instead of me having my multiple student loan accounts to deal with ON TOP of my wife's multiple student loan accounts to deal with, ALL our accounts could be merged into 1 account with 1 payment, and that would make our student debt far more manageable. We've got some in deferment, we've got some collecting late fees, and we dont even know whats going on with some.. its out of hand, and I am pretty confident in saying that if it stays as it is, they wont get their money.. not for my unwillingness to be responsible for my own debt, but because i'll probably die of old age before I even make a dent in the balance. If they want their money, they need to be easier to deal with. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

I graduate this last June (it's been about 9 months) and only just recently learned thattwo of my private loans originally for 18k and 23k have not only been combined into onemassive loan but that this amount has ballooned to about 73k with an absurd interest ratethrough REDACTED, which means that my monthly amount is over $700. REDACTED has offered anincome sensitive repayment option but with the extremely high interest rate (variable) Ihave little hope of ever paying off this loan during my lifetime unless I somehow manageto make a six figure income (which is unlikely to happen anytime soon). I do not want topostpone or accrue interest and work to pay it off but with these rates and terms and amonthly combined loan bill of 1000k (including my IBR with my federal loans, which I amhappy with) I can't see how this is ever going to be possible.

However, the individuals I have talked toon the phone have been civil though none of them have been able to truly help me with mysituation other than to make a few suggestions.

During the first few years after graduation, it was a challenge to find a job. At that time, I was able to use a deferment and forbearance option to delay payments.

Payments would need to be made no matter what. There were no other options for me - either pay or go into default. Both private lenders are similarly as non-negotiable at this point in time.

Collections department for the private loans call me at least 10 times a day, even on the weekends. Call my family and email me at least 10 times a day as well. I have tried over and over again over the years to negotiate something that is income sensitive, but they are only able to offer me a less payment on their terms which would still require monthly payments more than my monthly income. I have even asked if I could just pay something monthly just to get them to document that I make regular payments, but I was advised that I would still be contacted if the entire monthly payment was not in by the end of the month. The interest has made these loans so outrageous! It was my understanding in college, according to my financial advisor, there would be flexible repayment options, but this is so outrageous that there's no way - unless I close many big deals in real estate (which I intend to do) or have really successful companies (which I also intend to do) - then I most certainly would clear these loans - first and foremost! My mother and I (she is my cosigner - a factory worker) have good credit history and make regular payments to our creditors. The student loans are the only ones that are not even negotible enough- to a point where we at least meet in the midde. It feels really bad, distressful, overwhelming, and sometimes even thoughts of suicide around this neverending mound of debt before I can even get a good start at life.

I graduated from college in 2009 and since then my life has been a living nightmare. Mylender, REDACTED, refused to negotiate me paying less than $900 a month when I initiallygraduated. There was no option; it was simply pay $900 a month or pay the consequences. Ihave been harassed incessantly by REDACTED representatives who have called me (withoutexaggeration) up to a dozen times during a day, who have asked me questions like ""whatwere you thinking when you took out a loan for this amount and are now unable to pay itback?,"" and been told by them that I should move in with friends or family so I can takecare of my responsibility of paying back my loan. They have also attempted to scare meinto paying my loans, threatening that my credit would be destroyed and therefore my lifewould be ruined and they have also called and harassed any member of my family (though Idon't even have a co-signer) who picks up the phone trying to get in touch with me.Obviously, I would do anything to stop the horrible burden that my loans have put on meand my family, but what REDACTED does not understand is that I literally do not have themoney to pay what they are asking, or even close to what they are asking. It is as simpleas that. How can I pay off a massive amount of debt when I don't have the means to do so?I pay all of my other bills without a problem, but I simply cannot pay a ridiculous,irrational amount that REDACTED refuses to re-negotiate. Now I have to suffer theconsequences of getting an educations by receiving an insane number of phone calls, watchmy credit rating be destroyed and then face a whole new set of consequences when my creditis ruined. Thank you REDACTED for ruining my life, flat out lying to me when I signed thepaperwork for my loan and thanks to the federal government who has does done nothing tostop it. My whole life I was fed the lines ""get an education,"" ""you can't do in anythingin life without a college education,"" ""go ahead take out the loan for your education, it'sgood debt."" Great, did all those things, got the education and now I waitress for aliving. Pretty sure I could have accomplished that without my $125,000 of college debt.Our country and our government has epically failed me and so many others like me and now Iget to spend the rest of my life trying to clean that up. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? Any words that I choose to answer this question are going to be negative. I think REDACTEDis an evil entity who is ruining people's lives and the country. They are a backwardsorganization who should not be involved in anything relating to education. Their employeesare drones doing the bidding of what is essentially just another bank screwing over moremiddle-class Americans and leaving them hopeless.

CFPB-2013-0004-6353,Shani,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I was unemployed for a year during which time I was able to defer my student loans and lower the payment on my private loans. When I gained employment, I reinstated my federal loan payments, but at a lower rate and maintained the lowered rate on my private loans in an effort to also be able to pay back new debt acquired while out of work. I however, have now found out that my payments were set a rate which was so low that it did not cover the interest on either of my loans. So I have been making regular and on-time automatic payment but have not paid down any of my student debt. Rather, I have lost the amount I was able to pay down during my first 4 years out of graduate school. On one of my loans, I now owe more than the amount I borrowed and overall it appears as if I've only paid off a fraction of what I should have in the past 8 years I've been out of school. This will make it impossible for me to meet my loan period without having to make incredibly large payments at some point to catch up. This impacts my ability to pursue further education, possibly purchase a home and save for my retirement. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? I have had very little interaction with them. When I've called with a specific question, they have answered it, but I don't understand how I could not be notified that I was not making high enough payments.

I struggled when I gradated from Columbia and couldn't find a job and so I used up my allotted deferment. I did eventually find a job and paid on my loans for approximately 6 years and then lost my job. I still have no job and my employer lied in court and denied my unemployment benefits and so I could not pay my loans. I deferred my federal loans but the private loans could not be deferred and they would not negotiate with me or offer any kind of assistance even though I lost my job. They defaulted my loans and destroyed my credit which adversely effects my job search as companies will not hire me with bad credit. I'm ruined for life.

Quite frankly REDACTED has no interest in helping students, only taking money from us. Irecently suffered a financial downfall because REDACTED randomly decided to change theirbilling cycle for bogus circumstances. I notified them of the errors on their part andthey said per REDACTED policy, a refund to my account and the fees incurred would take7-10 business days. I find that funny especially since when one owes them an overduepayment it can be done right over the phone with the funds immediately coming out of one'schecking or savings account. Yet when REDACTED makes a mistake, they take their sweet timecorrecting the error. REDACTED does not care about the financial distress these privateloans cause students. They have horrible repayment and deferment options. If you wantlower payments, you're only paying on the interest, not on the balance to get theprinciple down. These unscrupulous practices cause millions of students to stay trillionsin debt. I also feel that universities should also be held responsible for student loandebt. Other than fattening the university's pockets for uses other than student aid,tuition hikes are out of control. No reason cited in the last decade is a plausibleexplanation for increasing student loan debts to astronomical heights. Students are notearning enough to pay back their loans plus be financially independent, which was thepoint of the education. As far as I'm concerned, the need for college educations and thedebts levied against students for borrowing is nothing more than modern day indenturedservitude. This is a serious problem in our country. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

CFPB-2013-0004-6409,Sharon,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender ingaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I am 54 years old. 2 years ago, I rolled my loans over into the Direct Loan Program. Butit is of no real benefit. The 20 years since graduation, have been a financial trainwreck for me all because I consolidated less than 20k in debt through REDACTED. I wasa single mom when I was in college. I received little to no child support through theyears after my divorce. Through the majority of my post graduate work life, I've earned anaverage of $10 -$15 per hour. My degree did give me the tools to remain employed, for themost part however, and I'm very grateful for that. Now that I'm finally earning whatis nearly a living wage, I'm to be destroyed anyway, by what has blossomed into an 89knightmare. REDACTED put my loans into default, illegally, during a stint ofunemployment when the loans were supposedly in forbearance. During that approximate yearof unemployment, the loans more than doubled. By the time I was re-employed, and earningless than in my previous job, I could in no way, make the “new” payment amounts beingdemanded of me. Eventually, the loan was sold back or reverted back to the guaranteeagency, REDACTED. But again, I could not make the payment amounts based on the higher 9%interest rate & newly fattened principal. So, my loans were given to a collection agency.REDACTED hounded me 8 and 9 times a day at work, called my supervisors and humanresource manager even after being told such calls were not allowed. Ultimately, thesecollection “agents” jeopardized my job and cost me a promotion. They called my familymembers, my neighbors, they threatened me with ""a personal confrontation/arrest at myplace of employment."" These agents were barely literate and there was no point in tryingto work with them or speak to them. I simply could not afford the payment amounts theywanted. It was an extremely stressful situation. I worked in a small very quiet officeand every time my phone rang and it was the collection agency, everyone in the officecould hear the conversation. Eventually, I ended up in the hospital with a collapsedlung... It took two surgeries to repair the lung and I missed a month of work. When Ireturned, my wages were being garnished. As of today, my less than 20k in student loansare worth 89k. Even though I'm paying back through IBR, I can never pay this back and Ican never retire. After 20 yrs of hard work and perseverance, I should be finally able topay my bills, and maybe even take a real vacation or at least, visit a dentist...butinstead, every spare cent I have will go towards the 89k of student loan debt until I'm 79years old. I can't help my own children with college expenses which hurts more thananything. I don't even want to think about retirement and having my social securitybenefits reduced until I've reached the 25 yr forgiveness period. I still have to requestforbearances in the winter months to pay for heat which starts the clock all over again onthe 25 years. Even with the Direct Loan, my interest rates are set at 8.25%...so eventhough I'm paying, I've watched the amount increase by 10k over the last two years. Thisis usury. Plain and simple. I worked so very hard just to get where I am standing. Idid not deserve this. If I could negotiate a reasonable amount to pay back, I would beproud to do it. But you've made it impossible. I made REDACTED a rich man. No otheraccomplishment of mine is worth noting, apparently. I can only hope that I die before Ireach retirement. I already know what it's like to go hungry. I used the student loanmoney to help feed my kids and pay rent while I went to school. I didn't take out a loanso that I could go on spring break. I often went hungry so my children would have enoughto eat. I would like the dignity of some sort of settlement that would allow me to payback a reasonable amount of debt and finish out my years in peace. God knows, I've earnedit. I'm getting a little old. I'm getting a little tired. Thank you for listening. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? Let me know when REDACTED are in jail. Usury is a crime under any other circumstance, isit not? The industry took full advantage of unregulated fees, penalties, interest rates &default to make indentured servants of us all. When I would call to try and work withany/all of the companies above, they would literally laugh at me. You removed allconsumer protections from people like myself. People who wanted nothing more than to getan education, get a job and pay back their student loans. Your de-regulation made thelast part impossible. You couldn't get child support from my ex-husband, but you can huntme to the grave because I chose the responsible path of being an a good mom, an excellentemployee and an enthusiastic student. My degree meant more to me than you will ever know.I was the first in my family to receive one. It gave me the strength and confidence tokeep putting one foot in front of the other. Please, don't deny other women like myselfthe opportunity to do the same because college has become an impossible goal...a debt trapfor people with limited funds and unlimited potential.",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-6409

I finished my associates at Johnson and Wales University 22 years ago. The loans were close to $20,000 when I left there. After graduation, I couldn't find a job and the job I worked at (I was a security guard because I couldn't find work in my field at this town I lived at) I couldn't pay the loans back.

I was able to obtain my bachelors degree in library science three years ago, and right now, the loans are still in forbearance due to my income. The loans is more than what I make a year (I make $25,000 a year being just a Administrative Specialist at a local community college). I pay as much as I can on the loans, but the interests rates making it higher and impossible to even think of paying it off. It's like this dark cloud that won't go away.

I have 7 private student loans all together. For one of my private loans, I was unable to reduce the monthly amount.

They refused to re-apply me for the program until I paid the $800 they said I owed. I did not have this money. It took me over a month of stressful phone calls and sticking up for myself before they solved the problem. They blamed the whole thing on me.

It turns outthat the calls were being made on individual loans instead of the more effiecient groupingof the 5.

One one particularly aggrivating occation I was asked to participate in aprogram that offered a $300 payment and the subsequent $50 payments for 3 months throughREDACTED. I was not able to make a payment by phone because my debit card did not have the""authorized"" system. Meaning since ""Pulse"" (example) was not a company REDACTED workedwith I was not able to make payments by phone with debit or credit. So, I mailed in mypayment. Because the operator FAILED to mention the payment must be recieved that day toqualify for the program, I was delinquent AGAIN and upon receipt of the $300 REDACTEDdisbursed the money as they saw fit amongst the 5 loans. With REDACTED I became sostressed about phone calls I had to stop answering because the thought of speaking withjust one more ignorant person made me physically ill. As for REDACTED, their staff andrules were not clear and presented condiscendingly.

My lender is Sallie Mae. Well, I would first like to say that all of the account managers I have spoken to were very polite and tried to be as helpful as they could, but there was very little that they could do under the terms of the my loans (I don't blame them for that). I would love to be able to pay off my private debt, but the only option that I have for lower monthly payments is an interest only payment that is only about $20 or so less than the regular payments, and is still well over $120. I have explained that I have exhausted all of my resources (that includes savings, family, and friends) simply trying to keep up and avoid default as long as possible as I search employment, and currently, I have nothing else I can give them, so I have missed payments since the start of the year, 2013. Without any option to negotiate any sort of extended payment plan, and no option for any sort of income-based plan, and no forbearance, I fear that I shall default this year. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? From my experience, the personnel has been fabulous. Even though I know there is not much that they can do they are understanding and try their best to give some comfort, which helps. The policy of the private provider, I believe, needs to be changed. If private loans are going to have the same protects for the lenders afforded to federal loans, then the consumer protections afforded to borrowers of federal loans should apply to private loans, and not just new loans, but old loans as well, as there are people who, because of this economic situation have fallen into financial hardship and ruin, and people like me, who are, or are heading there after investing a great deal of time and effort earning a degree with very scant options upon graduation. I cannot stress enough that there is also a very horribly misconception about today's youth. I can tell you that most of would have absolutely no problem repaying any debt, as long as we have the resources to do it. Contrary to the popular opinion, we did not borrow without the intention of paying it back. Simply put, I, and so many others, simply cannot, because we don't have anything. Thank you so much for listening to our stories, and I really hope that something good comes from this.

REDACTED has afforded me every deferment under the law. However, they would only allow meto pay the level payment, or nothing at all monthly. I've never been able to afford thelevel payment due to the extremely high interest rate (9%). I had made income basedinterest payments only for the first five years, and then they took the hard line approachof level payment or forbearance/deferment with me. Since I couldn't pay the level paymentand they wouldn't work with me otherwise, I had to use up all my forbearance/defermentjust to make it work without defaulting until the William D. Ford act came along. That'sgreat, but it still doesn't ease the burden. The Principal of $38,000 that I borrowed in1994 (at the height of Clinton Era prosperity) is now over $160,000. I fully accept thatI'm responsibly obligated to repay my debt, however these tactics used by REDACTED,especially at my unreasonable interest rate, are more akin to loan sharking than lending.Plus, REDACTED has government support through the typical cronyism. Due to mitigatingcircumstances of divorce, 2001 terrorist attacks (when I was living in NYC), and the 2008recession, I have never been able to pay until now. But, even with the WD Ford Act andbetter income, I'm still crushed by student loan debt. I could write a book on the corruptpractices of REDACTED. In fact, I probably will. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? REDACTED sucks. Period. Loan sharks supported be the federal government. They'veoutsourced all the calls to the Philippines, and the sweat shops they run there arestaffed by barely understandable English speaking reps who have a turnover rate higherthan McDonald's. I've been dealing with REDACTED for over 17 years now, and I can assureyou that they are corrupt as it comes. They even rounded up my interest rate when Iconsolidated with them from a true average of 8.25 to 9%. Why? Are they not adept enoughat math to use fractions of interest points? They seem to be when it benefits them. Also,why does any lender get an interest rate of 9% on a student loan ever? It seems way tohigh for a loan like this. I know it's not a secured loan, but a borrower can't evenbankrupt out, so it seems lower risk than most other consumer debt through credit cards.Don't even get me started. I will write a book, I'm thinking.  ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-6618

CFPB-2013-0004-6624,Whitney,D,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. Right out of undergrad, before securing full time employed but after repayment started, I negotiated a smaller monthly payment for a short term. it was lifted once i acquired full time employment, and I made my full payment amounts at that time, though it was a struggle at first because of a low starting salary. I have endured a period of unemployment since completing my graduate degree, during which time I have had to apply for unemployment deferment. I have a part time job that does not provide enough hours/pay for me to make payments, so I have continued to use unemployment deferment, at their suggestion. Last year I landed a contract position with full time hours for approximately 5 months. It didn't pay me enough for me to afford my student loan payments, so rather than negotiating a new payment amount, they told me to apply for a forbearance. I did. I lose sleep over the fact that I'm not making any headway on paying off this debt, but I feel like my options are all or nothing, and I don't know what will happen when my unemployment deferment gets used up (which I expect to be soon) if I am unable to find a full time job. It is an extremely tough job market, and I want more than anything to find a job and pay off my debts, but I have to look for higher salaries in order to afford my payments, and those are hard to come by these days, especially if one has been out of work for any period of time. About 8-9 years ago it would have helped to have been able to consolidate my federal and private loans into a single monthly payment, but was told I couldn't do that. I understand why, but it still would have helped. All together I was paying about the equivalent of rent for a small apartment for my student loans and had to live with my mother. I have to live with her again now, and do not see an end in sight this time. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

This was a nightmare. I originally borrowed $65,000 that has ballooned to $150,000 after 20 years of being enslaved by this unreleasable debt.

How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? The private student and federal student loan providers are an obvious predatory loan. They are non-releasable, relatively very high interest rate at 8%, daily interest accrual and capitalized interest during any forebearance, rehabilitation or consolidation. They are truly punitative and unforegiving and have ruined some of the best years of my life. They are even cruel, since there is no relief in bankruptcy court.

My lender explained to me that my only option to reduce my monthly payment was to make""interest only"" payments, which I did for a two year period because I wasn't making muchmoney at the time (shortly after graduation). However, since my loans need to be paid backwithin a finite amount of time, now that I'm done with the 2-year interest only period, myregular monthly payment is now even larger than it was before because the interest onlypayments left me with the same amount of principle owed, but even less time to pay itback. I should point out that I was still paying over $250 per month even when I was onthe interest only payment plan. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? I can't say anything bad about the individuals who work for my lender. They're just doingtheir jobs. And I also recognize that I am the one who borrowed the money, so it is myresponsibility to pay it back. But at the same time, I live under the constant stressthat I am one bad break away from total financial collapse. If I didn't have my wife tohelp me pay my loans, I simply wouldn't have enough money to pay for rent, food, basicliving supplies, and my student loans. I would be living with my parents, just like mysister is (due to her student loan debt), even though they can barely afford to livethemselves right now. If I lose my job, or if I get injured and have to go on disability,I won't be able to afford my student loan payments anymore, and I know that my lender(REDACTED) would have no sympathy for my situation. The only reason I haven't had anytrouble with them yet is because so far I've been able to make my payments on time eachmonth. But I have a friend who has fallen behind with the same lender, and he told me itonly took a few months for REDACTED to threaten to foreclose on his parents' house becausehis mother co-signed his student loans to help him get a better interest rate, and istherefore also responsible for the debt. My parents declared bankruptcy a few years ago,but I know REDACTED would still try to get anything they could from my mother (whoco-signed my loans) if I ever fall behind on my payments even though there is no way shecould afford to pay them.

I tried to consolidate my private loans that I had taken out through REDACTED throughREDACTED. Because of my non-existent credit score, I was denied. When I called to see ifthere was anything I could do (because I literally cannot afford my loan payments) I wastold there was no way I could consolidate my loans. This does not make sense. Because Ihave a non-existent credit score, I was not able to consolidate. Therefore, I was not ableto make full payments on my loans. This in turn created me a credit score, but a bad onesince I had technically defaulted on loan payments. This then made it more difficult toconsolidate. When I called to complain on the logic of this vicious circle, I wasrepeatedly ignored. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider?

I am an alumni of Pepperdine University Graduate School of Education and Psychology andgraduated in 2002. Subsequent to completing my degree, I continued my education at theOrange County Campus of the Illinois School of Professional Psychology which then becameArgosy University in Orange County California. I graduated in 2008 with a Doctor ofPsychology in Clinical Psychology with an Emphasis in Forensic Psychology. I had completedall requirements of the program in August 2006 but had waited to have my dissertationsigned off to make an official graduation date in 2008 from a school that had becomeaccredited by the American Psychological Association. Before these degrees were completed,I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology from Portland State University in PortlandOregon. In July 2007 I was involved in a motor vehicle accident. I was stopped intraffic and was rear ended. The car that hit me was going so fast it lifted my truck andshe drove under me and shoved me into the car in front of me and the other two in front ofthat. After the accident, I was left with left frontal and left temporal lobe damage fromthe force at which I was hit. Permanent symptoms of this damage include significantcognitive difficulties such as information processing, learning, expressive verbal speech,word retrieval, memory loss and sleep and fatigue regulation The Mild Traumatic BrainInjury has essentially rendered my ability to practice as a licensed psychologistunattainable. I have an education I can't use, over $212,000 in student loan debt, anadditional $70,000 in student loan debt that has defaulted, continuing medical bills (Iwas left with $5 after the $100,000 settlement, which then went to another co-pay) with noincome. I am currently unemployed and most of my loans are on an unemployment deferment.When I am employed again, they will demand $1,300 a month which without being able toobtain a license and use the education I obtained, I can not obtain a position that Icould survive on...or pay that kind of money for the loans. Is there somethingthat could be done to help someone in this type of predicament? Are there alumni who wouldbe able to assist someone in significant need? After the accident all of my creditcards were racked up as I used those to pay medical bills because I had no other way ofpaying them. I have been working with Pacific Debt in an attempt to negotiate and pay offthose bills. However, I will never qualify for a mortgage with such significant debt,especially one I'll never be able to pay down. It seems the ones who attempt to go aboutlife the right way have the most difficult time than those who use taxpayers to theiradvantage. Any information you may have would be helpful.

Told me I could never get away from the debt. I would have to die, or become 100%disabled. Told me I could never buy a house or a new car. When a family friend who is afinancial advisor tried to reason with them when I turned 60, he told them he had foundthat they and the Federal & State loans were all owned or affiliated with REDACTED. Weoffered a lump sum settlement to all, and they laughed. (My mother had died, and left me asmall bequest for my old age.) So, month by month, REDACTED Federal got it all and now Ihave notheing but living expenses. I had a rare fungus that the medication cost almost$1,000 per month. Insurance did not cover it. I finally went on medicare, and had surgery,but I am still on the drug, and we all know about the donut hole which I have almostfilled and it is only March! My company is small and struggling in this economy. I ambeing paid at entry level still, and doing four jobs due to cut backs. For heaven's sake,I am 65 years old and tired! I have very little saved for old age, and must work until Iam 70 as I need the full social secruity. I drive second hand car, live in a small rental,never go on vacations, and can't figure out how to deal with the Federal and State loans.I'm out of disposible money, my Sister paid for a year, and now she is out of money. Themethods of computing interest on interest and penalties triples these loans so you canNEVER pay them off. Ask any debt attorney. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? The one private loan I had was for about $5,000 but with interest and penalties swelled toabout $25,000. I could not pay after some years, trying to manage my Federal and Stateloans. The account was sold to REDACTED who got REDACTED Law Firm to sue me in StateCourt, despite my written offers to settle for what I could afford or set up payment plan.I followed through, and on the eve of hearing, they dismissed. It was not worth theirtime, as I would have asked for mediation and documented it was rediculous to pursue me. Iwill add the the REDACTED Law Group is renowned for underhanded and illegal tactics, andthe agent went so far as to call my office, hollar at my Staff, and threaten me. Anattorney friend told me it was not really worth their time, once they could not bully orscare it out of me. During my professional career of 5 years, I did over $120,000 worth offree and deeply discounted work for the poor and disempowered. I had to go on my own, asthere were no jobs available when I got out of Law School at 43 years old. So I went on myown, and went broke.

CFPB-2013-0004-6782,Suzanne,J,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender ingaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. This is a very long story but the basics are that I did start repaying my loans whileliving with, and taking care of, my elderly mother and stepfather. My stepfather'sout-of-pocket medical expenses bankrupted them, and I helped with their medical care. Thethree of us combined out incomes to survive. When my stepfather died in his sleep in 2008,the brunt of the household expenses fell upon my mother and myself. My mother becamefrail after his death and went into a nursing home supposedly for 20 days ofrehabilitation covered by Medicare. Then the brunt of the household expenses fell upon me.I paid the mortgage, taxes, utilities, and fell behind in my student loans. I filed for adeferment. The care my mother received was so poor she was transferred to a hospital for 9weeks to recover from the ORSA, MRSA, and gangrene she suffered at the nursing home. Bythen she had to be put on Medicaid and a lien was placed against her home. She wastransferred to another nursing home for 2 years. The brunt of stress was on me for thehouse, the taxes, the paperwork, and my job. I thought my deferment paperwork was faxedappropriately but the lender in Utica turned it over for default. The default happened atthe same time I took my mother by ambulance from the second nursing home to a hospitalwhere she was found to be septic with pneumonia, dehydration, overdrugged, UTI, and inkidney failure. She was in the hospital for 6 weeks, and finally returned to her home withHospice, and me taking care of her. The lender in Utica insisted I fax paperwork to themor the account would go into default. I told them I could NOT leave my dying mother aloneto go fax anything but they insisted I MUST or go into default, so I left her and went asfast as I could to fax that paperwork. The account went to Boston, in default, becauseUtica said they never received it. My mother died, then the default paperwork came at thesame time as all the death paperwork. I was overwhelmed for months. She died in April. InSeptember our region was flooded, twice. Hurricanes Irene and Lee crippled our region. Ifiled with FEMA, but was unable to receive help because the house was never transferred tomy name, and nursing home Medicaid had the first lien against the house. That was whenBoston's lender contacted me about the default. I explained ALL of this, and thought Iwas in deferment. They asked me to fax proof. I told them it would take time to documenteverything because of the floods, but I worked on it. Finally when I did fax over 36pages to them, they said it was too late and they had sent my account to Seattle. For afew days both Boston was trying to reach me and work out some sort of reduced-paymentplan, and Seattle's ruthless company was threatening me with going after my wages. Iremember crying for hours, and Boston was trying to pull the account BACK from Seattle.That was when I learned two companies cannot be trying to collect on the same debt. Iwish I had brought that to someone's attention at the time but who would I bring that tofor justice? Who sticks up for just one person? I was grieving, living in flood-damages,and struggling in every possible way. Who would I have reported that violation to? ThenBoston did try to work with me. Again I faxed information to them, only to learn if it isfaxed after 5:00 pm. it would be shredded for privacy concerns. The truth is though thatI faxed after 5:00 because it was so embarrassing to fax this from work. VERYembarrassing, but not as embarrassing as having a lien placed on my wages. I rememberwhen Boston told me my payments would be nearly $300/month. I started to cry, and said Ijust could not do it anymore. Between paying funeral expenses, flood repairs, mortgage,taxes, everything....I just did not want to live anymore. I was done. Then a managercame on the phone and started to really advocate on my behalf. I remember sobbing andjust being defeated by everything combined, all because some jerk in Utica never took myfax off the fax machine and processed my deferment. Boston worked out a plan where I paid$50/month for 9 months to be rehabilitated. I did that, completed that, and now I amtaking paralegal courses to learn more about Business Law and laws in general. I havenoticed REDACTED is beginning to telephone again and I do not know why. I am enrolled atthe part-time level and I believe everything is in order but they are starting to callagain. Meanwhile, I have applied twice for mortgages and have been turned down because ofmy student loan debt and default issues. I don't know how I am going to live as a publicservant in a low-income district, if my student loan issues are working against my creditrating. I have worked for 7.5 years at the same library in the same low-income districtin one of the poorest counties of New York State. I would hope there is aloan-forgiveness program that could be applied to my position, particularly with the FEMAissues factored in. Lastly, I must add that when the Boston people were involved, therewas an $8,000.00 penalty added to my loan for the default. It was horrible. Later, afterthe 9 months completed by the default rehabilitation, an examiner advocated the penalty beremoved because they believed I had a moral obligation to take care of my mother.

After college, I was able to serve a year with an AmeriCorps VISTA program, and was toldthat I would most likely qualify for deferring my student loans during the year. Mymonthly stipend with VISTA was 810/mo, and the program restricts participants from havingany other form of income, so a period where I wouldn't have to worry about my loans wouldhave been really important. My Direct federal loans were easy: I just requested the changefrom the AmeriCorps online portal and bam, it was so. The loan that I had gotten throughREDACTED my first year of college (when I had been rejected for other loans because of myparents' bad credit history, and didn't know I was eligible for federal loans since theywere not mentioned in my financial aid package) sent a brief message that I was noteligible, and that was that.

I went into forbearance afterhaving trouble finding a job, and not being able to pay my loans. I was hoping to buytime. When my forbearance term was over, and I had no more forbearance left, I asked againif anything could be done, as I was sure I would default when I came out of forbearancebecause the payments were still too high. I was told by the customer service agent atREDACTED that I would have to LET my loans become delinquent after the forbearance wasover, and speak with a separate department, a collections department within Sallie Mae.

CFPB-2013-0004-6824,Patricia,Pennington,Dodge City,KS,67801,Credit Union of Dodge City," Many people go to college to better themselves and get a higher paying job. However, student loans hinder their debt ratio and sometimes make it hard to qualify them for a different loan. I know that we have to include loans that are in deferment even though they don't have a payment because we have to figure a consumer's ability to repay. A certain percentage is calculated on the full loan amount and that is used as their monthly payment, or if they have documents stating what their payment will be once it comes out of deferment, we can use those.

CFPB-2013-0004-6825,Adrya,Stembridge,Clarkston,GA,30021,," This initiative excludes public loans, which make up 85% of all student loan debt. Any proposed modifications to loans need to be adapted in a way to benefit the largest number of student loan borrowers, which includes those who have public loans. I like that the invitation for public comment includes questions regarding mortgages and auto loans. Student loans prevent citizens from making large purchases such as homes and automobiles. It also prevents borrowers from starting new businesses or otherwise contributing to the GDP. Is it good for America to have a growing class of pseudo indentured servants, who are held captive by a worsening job market and increasingly burdened by student loan debt? Prior to bankruptcy modifications in the 1990's, very few borrowers discharged loan debt in bankruptcy proceedings. Bankruptcy is itself is shameful and prevents filers from getting access to credit of any variety, and can affect the ability to find employment. Tuition should be directly linked with the real world value of education by restoring bankruptcy protections for private and public student loans. If the job market can bear increasing tuition rates, great - everyone is a winner. If there are not enough jobs to satisfy student loan debt, then the risk, cost and availability of student loans should be affected proportionately. This could cause fewer numbers of student loans to be handed out, while at the same time freeing up funds for citizens to rejoin the economy by eventually purchasing homes, cars, and starting new businesses. Thanks for your attention.                                                  ",http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CFPB-2013-0004-6825

CFPB-2013-0004-6828,Alexis,Duncan,Laurel,MD,20724,," I work for the federal government. Contrary to what has been published in the press, I make at least 30-50% of what other Certified Public Accountants in my profession make. The federal rules on time in grade and promotions and HR stuff have really held me back in low paying government jobs. I had to relocate my family in order to increase my salary which has been very disruptive on my youngest child. I have an older child who is in college right now. When I complete his FASFA, they don't take into account the loans that I currently am paying and it's like getting hit with a double whammy. One third of my loan balances is interest from not been able to pay while holding down these low paying government jobs. They need to allow those of us professionals who are underpaid to receive credit towards our loan for our public service. My loan have incurred $20,000+ of debt while being a public servant. I enjoy serving the public, but my childrern are suffering and paying for it too.

CFPB-2013-0004-6829,Alexis,Duncan,Laurel,MD,20724,," In addition to having $20,000+ in interest, did I mention the fact that I can't afford a mortgage? I was paying $752.01 in student loan payments. I am now paying 552.01 in payments and cannot afford to get a mortgage because my student loans are the half of house I don't live in. It is hard trying to get my oldest son through college. I am seriously contemplating going into private industry to get more money. I am a government worker who is very underpaid compared to my private industry counterparts contrary to all the mess in the media and what the senate wants to believe. Why isn't all this money I am paying taken into account when figuring the family contribution for my son? Not giving federal employees a pay increase in three years has not helped. To all those who make these decisions: why do federal employees have to endure ten years of making payments when we don't make that much money to begin with in order for us to see any loan cancellation. Ooops! As soon as the loan gets cancelled, here comes the IRS wanting you to pay taxes on the amount that was cancelled.
