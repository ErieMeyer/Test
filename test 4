I am still working on my 2nd Masters Degree and because of a scholarship I now have an adjusted financial aid need and owe the University $4500 in addition to the private loans. A private lender will not loan the $4,500 of tuition because I have reached my annual loan amount of $20,000 annually.

How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with?

The system is difficult to navigate while in school and universities are unable to help graduate students with families to secure additional funds for childcare and living expenses. When the tuition is not pain in full then the debt may cause a student to not finish finish their education and therefore the debt is for nothing.

CFPB-2013-0004-3967,kelly,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. Last summer when I had to quit my job, I called my private lender immediately to inform them and ask what my options were since I had no source of income. The woman repeatedly told me that i ""have no options at this time"". I asked her what would happen when I was unable to pay due to not having a job and she just kept repeating that I had no options at that time and refused to say anymore than that. Also, I began taking classes again in the fall and it has taken me over a semester to get a deferment worked out with a different private lender. Every time I called, they gave me a different answer on how to obtain a deferment. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? Very difficult!

CFPB-2013-0004-3968,Jess,NA,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender ingaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. I've contacted REDACTED on many, many occassions to try and lower my monthly payments. Theanswer was always that I was at the longest term possible (20 years) and that there wasnothing I could do short of a voluntary forebearance. Basically, since I have threeseparate loans from REDACTED, a voluntary forebearance means that I pay them $150 forthem to stop calling me 20 times a day for 3 months, so that they can turn around and adda huge amount of money to my principal after that 3 months. I've done it multiple times,because there have just been months that I couldn't make ends meet without it. I have a""good"" full-time job (a non-profit administrator), but I make only about $25,000 aftertaxes. My student loan payments far exceed my rent payments, which I've always been toldshould be your highest expense. The best advice I've ever gotten from REDACTED was ""maybeyou should increase your income."" Re-negotiated terms, a financially regulated cap oninterest rates (and please pro-rate them!!!) for student loans, NOT having the federalgovernment insure REDACTED's every last penny so they gut you for triple what you took out- any of this would help. In my experience, the negotiability of terms between federalloans and private loans is criminal - private loan debt and their unwillingness to workwith lenders makes my life a lot, lot harder. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Wouldyou consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to workwith? The personnel is ""professional"" in the terms that they read their scripts well when I callin crying, but I have never felt any particular care or empathy toward my situation or myrequests - unless the phone call ended in me handing over money. REDACTED is RELENTLESS(5-10 times a day) with their communication - calls, emails - after just 10 or 15 days ofa late payment. I think about my student loan debt every single day, and my experience hascaused me an incredible amount of psychological and emotional stress (even when I pay mybills!). I completely believe that REDACTED has absolutely zero interest in helpingstudents achieve educational goals - their interest is in profit - despite how they marketthemselves.

CFPB-2013-0004-3969,Jess,S,,,,Young Invincibles," Please describe in detail your experience trying to work with your private lender in gaining affordable payment options, particularly when payments were causing you distress. What really pissed me off was ""deferring payment"" caused my interest rates to go up. If I can't afford to pay now because of financial hardship, what makes you think I'd rather ""defer payment"" just so I can owe more in the end! Makes me want to just not pay at all. How would you best describe your overall impression of your private loan provider? Would you consider personnel to be professional and fair or unprofessional and difficult to work with? Rude to work with. The people at the other end of the line have no sympathy for your situation. They are just trying to do their job.
